2020-07-06 07:00,HDFC MF: HDFC Mutual Fund proposes to roll over close-ended fund by 18 months,"HDFC Mutual Fund plans to rollover HDFC Equity Opportunities Fund – Series 2, a close-ended fund launched in May 2017 with a tenure of 1126 days, by another 18 months. The scheme has assets of Rs 955 crore, and investors agreeing to rollover need to give an consent by July 13. However if no consent is given by investors, the money will be returned to them.The NAV of the fund was Rs 8.38 as on July 3. That means, investors who came in at the NFO and paid Rs 10 per unit, stand to make a loss. It has underperformed its benchmark S&P BSE 100 TRI, with fund losing 4.69% annualized over a three-year period, compared to its benchmark gaining 3.75%.In a note to investors, the fund manager said there is merit in staying invested in the scheme. He believes that impact on most businesses is likely to be limited till FY21 only and corporate profitability should normalise by FY22. “Though the earlier investment strategy has not worked out as planned, the redemption date happens to be in the period where the equity markets are depressed. The stock prices have fallen sharply and equity valuations are quite attractive. Thus, it is not the appropriate time to withdraw funds from equities, in our opinion,” says the fund manager.However, financial planners believe existing investors should come out of close end funds and allocate that money only to open end equity scheme. “Investors could book a loss and come out. They can redeploy the money in an open end equity mutual fund scheme which gives them the flexibility to exit when they want or add more money should they they wish to,” says S Shankar, a Chennai-based financial planner.The scheme which was launched during the bull run of 2017, looked to protect downside by buying Nifty options. At inception, the scheme took positions in NIFTY 3 year Put options with a strike price of 9,600. The cost of put options was 6% thus leaving the scheme with only Rs 94 to invest with. As the Nifty closed above the strike price of 9,600 on the date of maturity of options in June 2020, the put options expired without value and the strategy to limit the downside did not materialize as envisaged, thus affecting returns.On the fundamental front, the portfolio construction was focused around corporate banks, recovery in capex cycle and shift in market share from unorganized to organized businesses. The fund manager expected bottoming of the NPA cycle, recovery in capex and organised sector benefitting post implementation of GST to play out in the coming years and built a focused portfolio around it, which did not work as anticipated and was further impacted as the economy was hit by Covid 19.In the note the fund manager points out that contribution of top 5 stocks in overall NIFTY 50 returns was 80% in CY19 and 150% in CY18, which impacted scheme returns. Further, the performance of large caps and mid/small caps diverged sharply over the past 2 years and the scheme being a multi cap scheme, invested in stocks across market capitalization and thus its returns were also impacted due to this sharp divergence.","HDFC Mutual Fund plans to rollover HDFC Equity Opportunities Fund – Series 2, a close-ended fund launched in May 2017 with a tenure of 1126 days, by another 18 months.
The scheme has assets of Rs 955 crore, and investors agreeing to rollover need to give an consent by July 13.
However if no consent is given by investors, the money will be returned to them.The NAV of the fund was Rs 8.38 as on July 3.
That means, investors who came in at the NFO and paid Rs 10 per unit, stand to make a loss.

2020-08-12 07:00,RIL most sold stock by mutual fund schemes in July,"Mumbai: Despite a rise of 21.35% in July and multi-billion deals with global tech giants and investors, Reliance Industries Ltd was the most sold stock by mutual funds in the month as equity schemes' inflows turned negative for the first time in four years. Mutual fund equity schemes sold Reliance Industries' shares worth ₹6,674 crore in July, according to data sourced from Edelweiss Alternative Research and ACE MF.

According to analysts, fund managers opted to book profit following the robust rally in the stock. They said that there was a tactical shift in the investor portfolio from Reliance Industries to the partly paid rights shares, which are trading simultaneously. Extreme exuberance for the company has driven stock prices to record high in July as it jumped over 100% from the lows it witnessed in March. The stock has risen 41% in this year so far, outpacing benchmark indices.

However, despite the sell-off by equity funds in July, RIL is still in one of the top 10 holdings by almost all mutual fund houses. Among major asset management companies (AMCs) RIL is one of the top ten holdings for Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, Axis Mutual Fund, HDFC MF, ICICI Prudential MF, IDFC MF, Invesco MF, Kotak MF, State Bank of India MF, UTI MF and Motilal Oswal MF, according to Edelweiss Alternative Research and ACE MF data.

In July, RIL shares were downgraded by few analysts citing steep valuations after a robust rally. However, despite the cut in ratings foreign brokerage firms CLSA and Goldman Sachs said the stock will see upside to the current price. While downgrading its rating from ‘outperform’ to ‘buy’, CLSA analysts said while its long-term promise and underweight position in portfolios may support the stock price, large valuation surprises may be difficult in the near term.

Meanwhile, other stocks which were sold most by mutual fund schemes in July included HDFC Bank and HDFC with an outflow of ₹2,072 crore and ₹1,546 crore, respectively. Among large caps, Axis Bank, Bharti Airtel and Hindustan Unilever also saw cut in exposure by equity mutual fund schemes in July.

Technology major Tata Consultancy Services was the most bought stock in July with an inflow of ₹886 crore followed by PI Industries, ACC, Page Industries and Balkrishna Industries.

Equity mutual funds saw the first monthly net outflow of ₹2,480.35 crore in four years in July due to higher redemptions or profit booking as markets rebounded sharply after the covid-led crash. The systematic investment plans' (SIPs) inflows declined to 22-month low in July at ₹ ₹7,830.6 crore.

“Investors tend to book profit and make a temporary exit as markets inch up to higher levels. Also, the disconnect in the markets and macro picture and likely fall in household cashflows resulted in some profit booking,"" said HDFC Securities Ltd.

Yes Bank said the deal value will be determined at the time of closing the transaction. The deal is likely to be complete in eight to 12 months’ time.

Yes AMC had a net worth of Rs 49.7 crore and revenue of Rs 33 lakh for the financial year ended March 2020.

Yes Mutual Fund is the smallest of India’s 44 mutual funds by assets under management. It had average assets under management of only Rs 56.98 crore for the April-June quarter, according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India.

This is a third of the average AUM of the second-smallest fund house, Shriram Mutual Fund, and a fraction of the average AUM of Rs 3.5-3.6 trillion that market leaders SBI Mutual Fund and HDFC Mutual Fund command.

Yes Bank has been struggling for the past several months as bad loans soared and it failed to raise fresh capital. In March, the bank was rescued by a group of state-run and private-sector lenders under a plan monitored by the Reserve Bank of India and approved by the government. As per the plan, State Bank of India took a 49% stake in the cash-starved lender while ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bandhan Bank and mortgage lender HDFC Ltd also pitched in.

As for Khemka, he set up White Oak Capital in 2017, two months after quitting Goldman Sachs as managing director and chief investment officer of global emerging markets equities.

During his stint at Goldman, Khemka set up an India-focused equity fund in 2006 and oversaw emerging markets assets worth $5.3 billion.

The investment firm’s first India-dedicated debut fund had raised about Rs 1,200 crore (over $150 million) from high-net-worth individuals in 2018.

In April last year, VCCircle reported that White Oak’s second fund is exploring funding opportunities before initial share sales. The closed-ended fund has an investment window of four to five years and would back listed companies.

White Oak also advises London-listed Ashoka India Equity Investment Trust, which mainly invests in securities listed in India and listed securities of companies with a significant presence in India. The fund previously backed HDFC Asset Management Company.","White Oak Capital Management, a boutique investment management and advisory firm set up by former Goldman Sachs executive Prashant Khemka, will acquire the mutual fund arm of troubled private-sector lender Yes Bank.

Besides, on the sectoral front, it is quite concentrated as 68 per cent of the assets are dedicated towards the top three sectors. Moreover, this fund follows a value investing strategy.

2020-08-20 22:43,Pune Inc’s market value surges 35% since first lockdown,"Pune: The push from foreign investors and hopes of successful vaccine trials propelled the market capitalisation (m-cap) of top listed Pune-based firms by 35% from March 27 to August 14 this year.

Market analysts said the rise in m-cap can also be attributed to the progressive unlocking of the Indian economy. They said the gain was more significant when compared to the first trading week after the first nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25.

In the week that the first major lockdown was announced, the traded value (m-cap) of top 28 firms in Pune was at a cumulative Rs 3,87,765 crore as on March 27. This rose to Rs 5,25,115 crore as on August 14. These 28 firms represent over 95% of the m-cap of Pune-based firms.

The m-cap of all firms listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) grew by 34% to Rs 151 lakh crore over the same period.

In an investors’ note, HDFC mutual fund attributed the increase to foreign portfolio investments, hope of a vaccine and progressive turnaround of the economy.

Compared to March 27, the 28 Pune-based firms gained between 3% and 156% in market value. The m-cap of three Bajaj Group firms (Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto), representing about 70% of the m-cap of Pune-based listed entities, grew by 35%. Bajaj Auto, which said it managed to sell in June and July this year 68% of the number of vehicles it had sold in the same months last year, gained 45% in stock value since March 27.

Half of the 28 firms outperformed the average gain of 35% as per the traded value of these stocks as on August 14. “We cannot say that it is all a gain of fundamentals. There are issues like moratorium, bad loans, falling demand due to job losses and salary cuts. However, consumers with money have little to invest in other asset classes. Gold is at an all-time high and so people are investing in stocks directly,” a Mumbai-based analyst closely watching some of the top Pune firms said.

The registered investor base has also increased to 5.29 crore from about 4.5 crore a year ago.

Apart from these three asset management companies (AMCs), at least three investment firms have also shown interest in buying a minority stake in L&T Mutual Fund, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. According to the first person, these include Avendus Capital and private equity players including New York-based Blackstone Group and ChrysCapital, which are looking for 10-15% stake. The suitors are attracted by the potential of a profitable exit whenever the fund house gets listed, this person added.

So far, only AMCs are publicly listed—HDFC Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund (erstwhile Reliance Nippon Asset Management).

“AMCs are available at low valuations now. So, the prospects of exiting investment with a relatively much higher valuation in the event of listing exists, which is attracting PE players,"" the first person added.

According to data provided by Value Research Online, a Delhi-based mutual fund (MF) tracker, L&T MF had 31 schemes with net assets under management (AUM) of ₹58,147 crore at the end of May. L&T MF has 16 equity schemes, which contribute a net AUM of ₹29,823.85 crore. These include L&T Nifty 50 Index Fund ( ₹28.64 crore) and L&T Nifty Next 50 Index Fund ( ₹15.46 crore). Value Research compiles data on the basis of fund fact sheets filed by AMCs.

L&T Finance acquired its mutual fund business in two parts: first by acquiring DBS Cholamandalam Asset Management in 2009 and then by acquiring the Indian operations of Fidelity Investments in 2012.

According to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India, in the March quarter L&T MF had average AUM of ₹71,056 crore, IIFL AMC Ltd, ₹1,832.44 crore, Axis MF, ₹1.38 trillion, and ICICI Prudential MF, ₹3.51 trillion.

An L&T spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation.""

Both Axis MF and ICICI Prudential MF spokespersons said the AMCs “do not comment on market speculation"".

“We continuously examine new opportunities as per our regular business operations and have nothing specific to share on this,"" said an IIFL spokesperson. Blackstone and Avendus spokespersons also declined to comment.

Citigroup Global Markets and JPMorgan have been appointed as the merchant banks for the sale of L&T Mutual Fund, said the second person.

2020-07-03 07:00,Mutual Funds AUM Plunge 8% In June Quarter,"New Delhi, Jul 3: Mutual funds' asset base dropped eight per cent to nearly Rs 25 lakh crore in the quarter ended June 30, mainly due to outflow pressure in equity and debt categories.

Average asset under management of the industry, comprising 45 players, stood at Rs 24.82 lakh crore in April-June quarter 2020, as compared to Rs 27 lakh crore in the preceding quarter, according to Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi).

The asset base of the industry was at Rs 25.5 lakh crore in the same period a year ago.

""The industry registered a decline of eight per cent on quarter-on-quarter basis as net inflows reduced across most of the assets and categories of mutual fund schemes,"" said Omkeshwar Singh, Head of RankMF, Samco Securities.

In spite of a 24 per cent climb back in the Nifty for the June quarter, funds struggled to grow AUM on account of outflow pressure both in debt and equity. While debt outflows were triggered by debt events, such as the Franklin Templeton issue, profit booking on rally led to equity inflows.

""Besides, lower investment, with economic uncertainty threatening jobs and pay cuts, could also be the reason for decline in the assets base. Moreover, fresh inflows were also relatively weak,"" Vidya Bala, co-founder, PrimeInvestor, said.

The average AUMs of all the top five mutual fund houses — SBI MF, HDFC MF, ICICI Prudential MF, Aditya Birla Sunlife MF, and Nippon India MF — have declined.

With an asset base of Rs 3,64,363 crore, SBI mutual fund continues to be the largest fund house in the country during the June quarter 2020, although the average AUM of the fund house plunged from Rs 3,73,536 crore in the preceding quarter.

HDFC MF, which is at the second position, has seen a drop in its asset base to Rs 3,56,183 crore from Rs 3,69,783 crore in the March quarter.

This is followed by ICICI Prudential MF at the third rank with an average AUM of Rs 3,46,163 crore in June quarter. It had an average AUM of Rs 3,50,743.5 crore in the March quarter.

Aditya Birla Sunlife MF, the fourth largest fund house, has seen its average AUM decrease to Rs 2,14,592 crore from Rs 2,47,522 crore.

The average AUM of Nippon India MF fell to Rs 1,80,061 crore from Rs 2,04,884 crore.","Average asset under management of the industry, comprising 45 players, stood at Rs 24.82 lakh crore in April-June quarter 2020, as compared to Rs 27 lakh crore in the preceding quarter, according to Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi).

It seems, you did you have a plan while investing in these schemes, and/or you lost either interest or nerve soon after investing in them. If you stopped your SIP because you were concerned about your investments, it clearly tells you that you do not have the necessary risk appetite to invest in equity mutual funds . Equity or stocks can be always risky in the short term. They are ideal for long-term as they have the potential to offer your superior returns than other asset classes.However, stopping and starting your SIP based on market conditions, forgetting about your investments, etc. may result in losing money. So, if you do not have the mental make up to deal with market volatility and short-term losses, you should not invest in equity mutual funds. You should never invest in equity mutual funds unless you have investment horizon of at least five to seven years.A moderate equity investor should invest mostly in multi cap mutual funds. If she wants to diversify to reduce risk, she can also take a small exposure to large cap funds.It is not possible to offer a personalised comment on the performance of your schemes since you have not given details like date of your investments. However, here are some general pointers. One, you have invested in a dynamic allocation fund, large cap fund, and mid cap scheme. The mid cap scheme is not in line with your risk profile. It is meant for aggressive investors with a higher risk appetite and ability to withstand volatility.All these schemes must be offering you negative returns, as most equity mutual funds are offering negative or meager returns in the last two years. However, two years are too short a period to judge performance of equity as an asset class. If you have the time, you may hold these schemes. Keep an eye on HDFC Top 100, though. The scheme has been underperforming its benchmark and category for a long period. If you do not have the stomach for the risk and volatility, you should sell your investments.If you do not understand anything about mutual funds, you should always go through a mutual fund advisor. Invest for a few years through an advisor, educate yourself, gain some experience and confidence before taking charge of your investments. There is no point in saving on a small commission and losing money by choosing bad investments and not tracking them and taking timely decisions.","If you stopped your SIP because you were concerned about your investments, it clearly tells you that you do not have the necessary risk appetite to invest in equity mutual funds .

Cogencis, Tuesday, Jul 14

By Chiranjivi Chakraborty

MUMBAI – India's top two mutual fund houses by assets under management, SBI Mutual Fund and HDFC Mutual Fund, have taken opposite views on the fate of Vodafone Idea, the third-largest telecom operator by subscribers.

The fate Vodafone Idea has been up in the air ever since the Supreme Court's judgment in October favoured the government's formula for calculation of adjusted gross revenue, which implied that the company had to pay 582 bln rupees in spectrum dues.

Along With SBI MF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, Axis Mutual Fund And UTI Mutual Fund Were Among The Big Mutual Fund Houses That Exited Vodafone Idea In June.

HDFC Mutual Fund, the second-largest fund house by managed assets, however, for the first time in at least eight years bought shares of Vodafone Idea Ltd in June in a major show of faith in the company’s chances of survival, according to data available with Cogencis' Corporate Fundamental Database and brokerage East India Securities.

Among the top 10 mutual fund houses in India, HDFC MF was the only one to have bought the stock in June as it lapped up 11.2 mln shares, data compiled by East India Securities showed.

HDFC Mutual Fund's buying is an indication that it is in the camp of investors who have since late May suggested that the telecom company will be able to get itself out of this existential crisis.

Hopes of Vodafone Idea's survival were kindled in late May, when Financial Times reported that Google Inc was exploring an investment in the company for up to 5% stake.

Vodafone Idea was quick to deny any such investment proposal from the US technology major, but the news report was enough to double the price of the company’s stock within 10 sessions and spark debate about a possible turnaround.

Brokerage CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, which upgraded the stock to ""buy"" from ""sell"" in March, earlier this month, said even as the company's the debt burden is ""huge"" and the risks of adjusted gross revenue dues persist, there is considerable room for the company’s average revenue per user to grow.

Currently, CLSA is one of only three brokerages that have ""buy"" rating on the stock with a majority of the 14 analysts that cover the stock having ""hold"" rating or below, according to FactSet.

As opposed to HDFC Mutual Fund, the country’s largest mutual fund house SBI Mutual Fund has completely exited its investment in the telecom operator in June, merely 12 months after re-entering the stock.

SBI MF took advantage of the 62% rally in the stock to exit it completely in June. It had likely invested in the company at an average 12.60 rupees per share back in June 2019. The price had again touched one-year high of 12.60 rupees in June this year, possibly giving the fund house an opportunity break even on its investment.

Along with SBI MF, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, Axis Mutual Fund and UTI Mutual Fund were among the big mutual fund houses that exited Vodafone Idea in June.

SBI MF's action along with that of 13 other mutual fund houses which either exited or pared their holdings in the telecom operator in June, is likely an indication that they believe the company's chances of survival are negligible, in the absence of any relief from the Supreme Court.

Vodafone said as much in its earnings statement for March quarter: ""...our ability to continue as going concern is...dependent on a positive outcome of the application before the Hon'ble Supreme Court for the payment in installments and successful negotiations with lenders.""

The apex court is expected to hear the company's pleas later this week and in the absence of any relief, Vodafone Idea is most likely to erase all of its net worth if it reports another quarter of consolidated losses. End

2020-06-15 07:00,Stocks SBI MF is betting on as ‘potential winners’ in this chaos,"SBI Mutual Fund’s Chief Investment Officer Navneet Munot announced recently that his fund house was excitedly scouting for winners amid the chaos that Covid-19 disruption has brought upon the stock market.We now know where his team has put the biggest bets. Some analysts do not agree the fund house has made the best choices.India’s largest asset management company has gone all out for Bharat Heavy Electricals ( BHEL ) in an apparent bet on the ‘Make in India’ theme. SBI Mutual Fund’s May portfolio overhaul also showed a lot of focus on Bharti Airtel, but Chief Investment Officer Navneet Munot’s team churned holdings in the most buzzing pharma sector and turned totally bearish on the several big private lenders.The fund house’s biggest addition during the month was BHEL, as the PSU giant announced plans to partner with foreign firms which seek to manufacture in India. The fund house bought 6.08 crore shares during the month. BHEL manufactures heavy electrical and transportation machinery. It recently commissioned a 270 MW thermal power plant in Telangana, but reported Rs 1,532 crore net loss for March quarter. Sales plunged by over a half.The stock traded at 0.38 times its book value as of Friday’s close, but analysts are mostly neutral-to-bearish. The stock had 13 ‘hold’, and seven ‘underperform’ recommendations on Reuters Ikon database.Mahantesh Sabarad of SBICap Securities said its business model has become outdated. “BHEL supplies heavy equipment for electrical power generation, primarily thermal power generation. We are already a country with excessive power generation capacity and demand is falling. So nobody would want to replicate a BHEL model,” he told ETNow. SBI MF also grabbed 1.10 crore shares of Bharti Airtel. The stock has lately become a favorite with analysts from the telecom space. It is already among the biggest gainers of 2020 among the blue chips, rising 23 per cent.Post earnings, Morgan Stanley hiked the price target for Airtel from Rs 575 to Rs 725 and said it is ‘overweight’ on the telco. CLSA has a price target of Rs 670. The company recently acquired an additional 6.3 per cent stake in Bangladesh’ Robi Axiata, bringing its total holding to 31.3 per cent.SBI MF also bought 10-75 lakh shares in Indian Hotels Company, another stock down in the dumps currently following the Covid-19 restrictions. Besides, the fund house picked up shares in Sun Pharma, Infosys, M&M Financial Services, HUL, ONGC, ITC, JSW Energy and ICICI Bank.Munot, who heads the team of fund managers at the AMC, wrote in his monthly newsletter earlier this month that SBI MF was “excited as we scout for winners amidst this chaos.”With a deadly mix of issues ranging from the pandemic, a halt to economic activities, country-wide migrant crisis, cyclones, border tensions with neighbours, a ratings downgrade, all coming together, India’s resolve is being tested on every front.“The response can be either to hope for normalcy to return or seek opportunity in this apparent chaos. Firms that take the latter approach are likely to survive and thrive,” Munot wrote.The fund house also went against the wind and became bearish on big private banks. It dumped 1.03 crore shares in Axis Bank during the month, and sold 6-42 lakh shares in HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, PNB, IDFC First Bank and Federal Bank.Other stocks that the asset manager sold in heaps during the month included Gujarat State Petronet (12 lakh shares), Emami, Torrent Pharma (6.8 lakh), ICICI Pru Life (8.07 lakh), Alembic (4.07 lakh) and Divi’s Labs (3.3 lakh).SBI MF also took new positions in Kalpataru Power, L&T Infotech and PVR but completely exited Adani Enterprises, Apollo Tyres, Atul, Canara Bank, Chennai Petroleum and Escorts.It should be noted that some of the buying and selling in shares mentioned above might have been done in passively-managed index funds, where any change in the index composition triggers a churn in holdings.SBI MF continued to be the top fund manager in the country with assets worth Rs 3.72 lakh crore. HDFC AMC with Rs 3.63 lakh crore and ICICI Pru AMC with Rs 3.17 lakh crore stood a close second and third.","The fund house bought 6.08 crore shares during the month.

2020-06-17 07:00,"Coronavirus impact: Gross inflows in equity mutual funds hit a 4-year low of Rs 12,950 cr in May","Rising impact of coronavirus infection and bleak market outlook is dampening investors' sentiments as gross inflows into equity mutual funds has touched a 46-month low in May. Equity-oriented schemes sales, including Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), fell around 11 per cent, month-on-month (m-o-m) to Rs 12,950 crore in May. Though, the fall was much sharper in April, at 51.8 per cent. With this, gross flows into equity schemes fell for the second consecutive month after September 2019. Redemptions fell too, 7.4 per cent in May. As a result, net inflows declined to a five-month low from Rs 6,213 crore in April to Rs 5,257 crore in May. Overall, the net asset under management of equity MFs declined 1.4 per cent m-o-m to Rs 6.5 lakh crore during the month.

After a decade's worst monthly decline in March, markets bounced back in April with a gain of 14.4 per cent but remained in a consolidation mode in May as the Sensex declined nearly 4 per cent.

Equity-oriented schemes derive 87 per cent of their assets from individual investors and their cautious stance towards mutual fund investments was clearly visible in the falling systematic investment plans (SIPs) over the past two months. Retail investors' monthly contributions, which touched its high of Rs 8,641 crore in March 2020, declined 3 per cent each in the following two months.

According to the latest fund folio report by Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities, total equity value of the top-20 asset management companies (AMCs) decreased 1.6 per cent m-o-m in May'20. Among the top-10 funds, the highest monthly decline was seen in HDFC Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund which fell 3.6 per cent each, followed by Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund (-2.4 per cent), SBI Mutual Fund (-2.2 per cent) and Axis Mutual Fund (-1.9 per cent).

2020-07-09 07:00,"HDFC AMC, Nippon Life AMC decline as equity fund inflows tumble in June","Shares of asset management companies (AMCs) were trading weak for the second straight day on Thursday in an otherwise firm market as equity fund inflows fell sharply in June.

Nippon Life Asset Management slipped 4 per cent to Rs 291, while dropped 3 per cent lower to Rs 2,490 in the intra-day trade on the BSE. On Wednesday, these stocks ended lower between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. In comparison, the S&P BSE Sensex was up 0.80 per cent at 36,618 points at 12:02 pm.

Nippon Life India AMC is the asset manager of Nippon India Mutual Fund, while is the investment manager to the schemes of HDFC Mutual Fund.

Inflows into equity mutual funds in June declined sharply to a four-year low of Rs 241 crore compared to Rs 5,257 crore in May. This is the third consecutive monthly decline in inflow in equity mutual funds, data by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed on Wednesday.

AMC’s almost 75 per cent of the total revenues are contributed by equity and the company maintained that equity will be the key focus area though they are cautiously optimistic regarding recovery in equity.

“Investors seem to be reducing their exposure to equity in the recent rally as retail sentiment remains weak. While SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) inflows also fell in June to Rs 7,927 crore from Rs 8,123 crore in the previous month, they remain largely stable,” ICICI Securities said in a note.

“A steep correction in equity has impacted both AUM and earnings momentum. The near-term outlook remains uncertain but structural changes, including an increase in financial savings, remain positive. It is expected to maintain its leadership through healthy AUM growth. Focus on strong operating efficiency and higher proportion of equity AUM is seen aiding profitability,” the brokerage firm said in March quarter results update.

MTM decline led to schemes falling in a low-value slab, enabling higher total expense ratio (TER) cushioning declining revenue. HDFC AMC’s business franchise is seen remaining strong with a substantial market share of 14-15 per cent and strong operational performance (39-40 bps). Hence, its strong positioning and superior earnings profile deserve, it said.

Analysts at Centrum Broking maintain HDFC AMC’s assets under management (AUM) growth estimates for FY21 and FY22 while accounting for lower employee cost and rebound in equity in FY22 (thus positively impacting yields). This might result in higher profit after tax by 4.5 per cent/11.5 per cent for FY21/FY22E vs previous estimates, the brokerage firm said in Q4 results update.","Nippon Life Asset Management slipped 4 per cent to Rs 291, while dropped 3 per cent lower to Rs 2,490 in the intra-day trade on the BSE.

2020-06-08 07:00,"Axis, IIFL, ICICI Prudential AMCs lead race to buy out L&T Mutual Fund","MUMBAI: Axis Mutual Fund, IIFL Mutual Fund, and ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund have emerged as top three contenders to acquire the mutual fund business of L&T Finance.

Three people aware of the talks between L&T Finance--parent of L&T Mutual Fund--and the potential buyers confirmed this, saying that apart from the three asset management companies in the fray, at least three investment firms have also evinced interest in buying a minority stake in in the fund house.

Avendus Capital and private equity players including New York-based Blackstone Group and ChrysCapital have been in discussions to buy 10-15% stake in L&T Mutual Fund, according one of the people cited above. The person said the investment rationale is driven by the potential of a profitable exit opportunity whenever the fund house is listed though a share sale.

As of now, only two asset management companies (AMCs) are listed on the stock exchanges: HDFC Mutual Fund and Nippon India Mutual Fund (erstwhile Reliance Nippon Asset Management).

""AMCs are available at low valuations now. So the prospects of exiting investment with a relatively much higher valuation in the event of listing exists, which is attracting PE players,"" said the person.

An L&T spokesperson said, “We do not comment on speculation.""

According to data provided by Value Research Online, a Delhi-based MF tracker, L&T MF had 31 schemes with net asset of ₹58,147 crore at the end of May. The fund house has 16 equity schemes, with net asset under management (AUM) of ₹29,823.85 crore, according to Value Research. These include L&T Nifty 50 Index Fund ( ₹28.64 crore) and L&T Nifty Next 50 Index Fund ( ₹15.46 crore). Value Research compiles data on the basis of fund factsheets filed by AMCs.

L&T Finance acquired its mutual fund business in two parts: first by acquiring DBS Cholamandalam Asset Management in 2009 and then by acquiring the Indian operations of Fidelity Investments in 2012.

According to AMFI, for the March quarter, L&T had an average AUM of ₹71,056 crore, IIFL Asset Management Co. Ltd. had an average AUM of 1,832.44 crore, Axis Mutual Fund recorded an AUM of Rs. 1.38 trillion and ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund had an average AUM of Rs. 3.51 trillion.

Axis MF and ICICI Prudential MF said AMCs ""do not comment on market speculation"". Blackstone and Avendus also declined comment.

""We continuously examine new opportunities as per our regular business operations and have nothing specific to share on this,"" said an IIFL spokesperson.

Citigroup Global Markets and JP Morgan have been appointed as the merchant banks for the sale of L&T Mutual Fund, said the another of the three people cited above.

“L&T Capital received four bids in March. Due to covid-19 and the lockdown, MF valuations have taken a massive hit. L&T MF is not willing to sell at these depressed valuations and the bidders want to revise their offer price...but the uncertainty is pushing the sale process,"" said the second person.

MF valuations remain a tricky process in India, even after the listing of HDFC MF and Nippon India MF. Ideally, listed AMCs should have provided the industry indicative guidance on price discovery. However, with two dissimilar AMCs listed, the traded share prices are not reliable indicators.

In India, mutual fund buyers typically tend to value AMCs on the basis of the AUM, with equity assets fetching the highest valuation followed by debt and then liquid funds. The other problem is deal opacity. With most AMCs unlisted, the real transaction price remains a closely-guarded secret.

According to a 30 September report by ICICI Direct Research, RNAM, whose market cap was Rs. 15,900 crore on 30 September 2019, was valued at 7% of AUM in FY19, which came down to 6.2% of AUM in FY20, and is expected to be 5.4% for FY21.

The value of HDFC AMC was at ₹54,545 crore in September. The valuation as a percentage of AUM was 16.3% in FY19, which came down to 14.6% for FY20 and is estimated to be 12.4% for FY21, said ICICI Direct Research.

2020-06-22 07:00,"The risk of another market sell-off definitely exists: Srinivas Rao Ravuri, PGIM India Mutual Fund","While the fallout of the lockdown will see transformation across sectors, there will be some companies that will actually benefit from the ongoing turmoil, Srinivas Rao Ravuri, Chief Investment Officer-Equities, PGIM India Mutual Fund tells ET Wealth.There are clear contradictions that investors are struggling to deal with. Markets are completely ignoring ground realities, trading 30% higher from recent lows. This is driven by global liquidity. The US markets are trading at multi-year highs. The US Fed is pumping in trillions of dollars to support the economy and some of this money is finding its way into emerging markets. That is not a comforting aspect.Markets always tend to look ahead. Some of the macro numbers like auto sales, cement, electricity and diesel consumption, are sequentially looking better. Lockdown is getting lifted, business are opening up. Markets are expecting things to normalise within the next year.But this kind of a sharp uptick is difficult to justify. The risk of another sell-off definitely exists. We are very cautious about the economic outlook. We believe recovery will be tough and will take time. The first priority for companies today is to survive. We want to ensure that we align with firms that will do what it takes to survive and do well over a period of time.Our portfolios are positioned to ensure that damage from any sharp sell-off is minimal. We are negative on NBFCs. These have had a great time for last 5-7 years. But today they face twin challenges. They are finding it difficult to source their raw material—finance—from sources they used to get in the past. Further, NBFC customers are typically of lower credit quality. They will have greater difficulty in getting back dues from customers. They will see more stress in the coming months.We will see transformations in many areas, particularly in some sectors. There are companies that will even benefit from this even as others take a hit. Telecom, online and digital players are the big beneficiaries. Hospitality, airlines are clearly vulnerable. Impact is neutral on consumer staples and low-ticket consumer discretionary.Nobody has any clue about 2020-21 earnings. It is a complete washout and entirely openended right now. So we are not looking at this financial year’s numbers. We are looking at where companies stand vis-à-vis 2019-20 earnings, which are known. Then we are looking at unfolding activity and based on that trying to derive scenarios for 2021-22. Surely whatever we are going through is beyond what anybody has seen.But are we saying that the basic demand drivers and basic human nature have changed? The answer is no. In some cases that demand has got deferred while in others, it has got downtraded. Somebody keen on buying the Rs 10 lakh car is now looking at buying a Rs 5 lakh car. But the basic aspiration has not gone away for the most part. So I am not worried about the basic demand drivers.There is a big difference in terms of size between HDFC AMC and what we are managing in PGIM India. But as a fund manager, my job is allocation—to the right stocks and sectors. I have to decide whether I bet 3% of my portfolio on a certain stock or 7%; whether I should be underweight or over-weight. To that extent, size does not really matter. But in a bigger fund, I could perhaps buy up to 20-30% of my desired allocation in one day. In a smaller fund, I can take my position in a matter of hours. So, smaller size is an advantage that way.I have strengthened a few processes in terms of sector and stock exposure and beefed up the research team. I have streamlined the extent of deviations we take at a sectoral level. Our size is very small now; it will take time to build scale. But PGIM is here for the long haul and the first priority is protecting and nurturing the brand reputation. Our performance over the past year has been very good. This is a result of strengthening of certain processes.Our philosophy is growth at a reasonable price. We believe investing in equities should be centered around growth. At the same time, what price you pay is equally important. Every fund house has its investible universe or list of approved stocks it can invest in.For us, we have three filters for a stock to get into that universe. First, the company’s net debt to equity should be less than three times. Historically, companies that have destroyed wealth invariably have one common trait—high leverage. Second filter is cash generation. If a company has not generated positive operating cash flows in 7 out of last 10 years, it can’t get into our universe. Third is demonstrated corporate governance. If there are any corporate governance issues, we stay away.We have been positive on pharma and chemicals for the last few quarters. We have been overweight in these segments relative to the benchmark. Many of the bets have worked in our favour. At the same time, we have been underweight on financials. This is for two reasons. Financials is a leverage play on growth. That leverage play does well in a growing economy. When growth is a challenge, leveraged players will have issues. Further, in the mid-cap fund, the financials in the benchmark are mid-tier firms. Owning tier 2 financials is more risky. We have stuck to the high quality, larger players in this space.","Some of the macro numbers like auto sales, cement, electricity and diesel consumption, are sequentially looking better.

Net flows into equity mutual funds tumbled 95% in June from the previous month as the recent rebound in the market prompted investors to pull money out and stay on the sidelines.

2020-06-29 07:00,Opinion | A guide to the proposed social stock exchange for NGOs,"Recently, a committee constituted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) submitted its recommendations on the creation of a social stock exchange (SSE). It will soon become clear which of these are accepted by Sebi and the relevant ministries of the government.

The committee hoped to do more than create a matchmaking platform for donors and non-profit and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It took a holistic approach towards the overall development of the social sector, and so its recommendations cover a broad range of areas.

At the outset, it is important to highlight that the recommendations do not affect the current ways that NGOs work, nor their existing avenues of fund-raising. They relate to additional instruments and means for raising funds. These can also help improve the visibility of NGOs, and build greater recognition and trust in the sector among funders and the wider community.

Secondly, several recommendations will benefit all NGOs, whether or not they raise money through the SSE platform. Specifically, the suggestions that go beyond new funding avenues for NGOs, and aim at the creation of a supportive environment for them, including: one, encouraging institutions like information repositories on NGOs (like GuideStar, BSE Samman, etc.) and social auditors for impact measurement; and, two, introducing standard reporting norms and impact measurement for NGOs that seek to raise money through the SSE. The committee has also recommended tax benefits and regulatory clarifications.

While the report lays out several funding instruments and structures for NGOs, its three key avenues for fund-raising are mutual funds, social venture funds, and zero-coupon-zero-principal bonds. To benefit from these, NGOs can:

One, approach a mutual fund house to promote a fund whose interest/returns its investors can donate to NGOs. An example of this is the HDFC MF Cancer Fund. Its investors get their money back from HDFC MF, but any interest or gains that are made are donated to select NGOs.

Two, keep track of how social venture funds (SVFs) are developing. Sebi’s alternative investment fund guidelines permit SVFs to function as “grants-in, grants-out"" vehicles for charitable purposes. The committee wants these popularized and encouraged for the NGO sector. Under this, a fund manager will pool grants from several donors and on-grant them to NGOs working in the SVF’s area of interest. As this idea gains momentum, NGOs working in areas specified by such a fund’s objectives should be able to reach out to it and ask to be considered for inclusion in its list of organisations eligible for grants.

Three, consider directly “listing"" on the SSE with a zero-coupon-zero principal (ZCZP) bond. A ZCZP bond works the same way as a donation. “Investors"" will fund the NGO based on its overall objectives or plan for a specific project and the social impact it will create. NGOs do not need to return the money or pay any interest on it. Because it is a bond, it becomes an instrument that can be listed on the exchange, providing the NGO both high visibility and credibility.

NGOs that use the SSE to raise funds will need to report the social impact they create, using a specified framework. This has been kept very simple, and most well established NGOs will find it easy to comply. A key purpose of any exchange is to reduce information asymmetry between funders and recipients. A consistent easy-to-understand format for information on and analysis of impact will help donors make decisions, boost transparency, and build public confidence in the sector. NGOs should also consider getting external organisations to help them measure social impact. While this won’t be mandatory at first, it will help them prepare; impact measurement will gradually become more sophisticated over the years, as third-party impact measuring agencies or “social auditors"" emerge.

Fund-raising on an SSE enables NGOs to get more publicity for their work, enabling them to attract a wider pool of donors. It can also help them enhance their reputation as leaders in the sector. Early movers will contribute to setting standards on reporting and impact measurement, and help build confidence in India’s non-profit sector.

Even if NGOs do not seek to use the new SSE platform in the near term, they can stay abreast of the way the social impact measurement and reporting framework develops and try adopting it. The framework recommended by the committee is easy to implement and flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of NGO activities.

The committee has also recommended that the proposed SSE set up a capacity building unit, along with a fund with an initial allocation of ₹100 crore. This fund would prioritize support to smaller NGOs and help them create the capacity they would need to report their social impact and even partly fund the cost of this exercise. The unit will also raise awareness and promote the fund-raising instruments available on the SSE.

Several tax benefits and other supportive regulatory clarifications have also been recommended by the committee. If implemented, all these proposals could help the country lay an inclusive foundation for social finance and boost the funding of this sector over the years to come.

2020-07-30 07:00,HDFC group eyeing M&amp;A opportunities: Deepak Parekh,"HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh (File photo)

MUMBAI: Deepak Parekh chairman HDFC said that the corporation is eyeing acquisition opportunities for group companies. Parekh indicated this in response to a shareholder query during the bank’s annual general meeting.

The country’s largest housing finance company is seeking shareholder approval to raise Rs 14,000 crore. Parekh said that one of the reasons for raising the capital was to have resources in place if there is an acquisition opportunity. “It is always better to raise equity from the position of strength particularly from overseas market. We do not know how long COVID-19 will last and we do see some inorganic opportunities for our subsidiaries,” said Parekh. He later added that the corporation always had its 'eyes and ears open' for acquisitions.

“From the utter despair that the world was in towards the end of March and the month of April, since then, there has been a great deal of stability in the financial markets. Global fiscal support towards the pandemic now stands at $12 trillion and monetary policy across the globe has eased through lower interest rates, liquidity injections, and massive asset purchases,” said Parekh in his speech to shareholders.

The HDFC group which currently has a market cap of nearly Rs 11 lakh crore has grown through acquisitions made by subsidiaries. HDFC Ergo General Insurance has acquired L&T General Insurance and Apollo Munich Health. HDFC Mutual Fund has grown acquiring several rivals including Morgan Stanley and Zurich Asset Management.

According to Parekh, the Covid-19 Pandemic was unlikely to reduce the demand for housing. “I think that the demand for small houses will go up. I have heard of many joint families who are now looking at buying separate small houses,” he said. Even in commercial real estate, there have been some big-ticket deals during the lockdown, Parekh said.

According to Parekh all the recessions India has gone through in the past – 1958, 1966, and 1980 were triggered by a poor monsoon that hit agriculture, and at that time agriculture was a sizable part of the Indian economy. “Today, the bright spot for India is the rural economy. A good monsoon, strong agricultural growth and government support through rural employment guarantee schemes is enabling rural consumption to lead India’s overall recovery. Food grain production is expected to hit a record high of over 292 million tonnes,” said Parekh.

2020-07-28 07:00,A Sad Saga: YES Bank Stock Trading and its Investors,"This is for those who are involved in retail investments. If you have recently or already invested, you must know stocks like Yes Bank. A bank that was the fourth largest private sector bank in the country. 400 rupees was once its share value when the bank was its peak. But in just one or two years, this stock lost all the investors’ earnings. Especially last year when the stock of the bank has stooped down to Rs 28 an all-time low. When the opportunity knocked their doors, the greed of the investors rose and, in this greed, they lost whatever they had earned.

How to judge profit and loss in a stock?

There is a very well-known opinion of analysts in the stock market about YES bank fiasco. The opinion is that you invest in companies that have good management, balance sheet, and governance. Also, don’t be tempted by its current situation. That is, if you get an average return then you should leave. This is because the higher the returns you expect, the greater the risk. But it is seen that most investors get caught in greed. Today if a stock is at Rs 10, then they see it at Rs 12.

Also, they invest when the shares reach very expensive levels. Or, for the lure of double overnight, bet on stocks with cheap 5-10 rupees. As seen recently. New and retail investors have placed bets on these stocks.

How was the share of Yes Bank?

The stock was at Rs 28 a month ago and today stands at Rs 11.10. It raised around Rs 13,000 crore last week through FPO. The FPO was priced from Rs 12 to 13. Now, this share is even below that. That is, people who bought into FPOs are also at a loss. Those who would have bought before that are also at a loss. So, who all would be benefited from this move?

Who made a profit in Yes Bank’s FPO

SBI has earned the most benefit. This is because when YES Bank’s stock fell to a low of Rs 5.55 in March, many banks invested money in SBI’s consortium. SBI got the highest share of more than 48 percent. Along with this were Axis, ICICI and other banks. SBI reduced its holding in FPO to 30 percent. It levied Rs 7,250 crore at Rs 10 per share in March.

Now four months later, SBI sold more than 18 percent stake in FPO for 13 rupees. That is, he got a return of 20-25 percent in four months. However, other banks have also sold stakes.

Who suffered at Yes Bank?

YES, Bank has suffered mainly from retail investors. Many investors put money in it when the stock was up to 400 rupees or 300 rupees. When the stock started falling from there, many investors invested thinking that now they are getting at half the price and will get returns. In this way, investors continued to invest in it. Even at 30 rupees, 50 rupees, 80 rupees were purchased. But the matter was reversed when SBI bought a stake in it. Here the stock of 5 rupees once again reached 89 rupees in 10 days. This is where investors got trapped again.

Investors thought that this stock would now go back to 200. But those who raised the stock from 5 to 89 immediately exited. The stock has returned to the same level today.

Why did the stock fluctuate so much?

Yes, Bank needed money from the beginning so that it could work as per RBI rules. When its need for money is now fulfilled through FPO, then why is the stock falling apart? According to analysts, in this, SEBI should investigate on what basis this 5 rupee share went to Rs 89 and then on 11 bases. If it went to 89 in the name of SBI, then SBI is still in it. But why is the stock falling apart?

What is the view of SEBI

By the way, the news is that SEBI is investigating some brokers in FPO. The reason was that a lot of shares were sold in it before the FPO opened. A month ago it was at Rs 28 a share. 10 days ago it was at 18 rupees. After all, why did this stock fall to Rs 11 even after FPO.

The stock has been falling continuously since seven trading days

YES Bank shares have fallen for the seventh consecutive trading session. YES Bank shares have fallen below the FPO price. It is getting lower circuits every day. YES Bank shares have fallen 76 percent so far this year. YES Bank shares have fallen 56 percent since the FPO’s floor price was released.

There is a possibility of a loss of Rs 2,800 crore

Today’s day is extremely important for Yes Bank. This is because the bank’s result is also going to make headlines today itself. The bank expects a loss of Rs 2,800 crore in the June quarter. The bank will use the funds raised from the FPO to expand the business. These include solvency, capital adequacy ratio, and regulatory requirements. Earlier last week, on Thursday, Yes Bank shares also saw a 20 percent lower circuit.

Institutional investors (QIBs) who bid for Yes Bank’s FPO include SBI, LIC, IIFL, HDFC Life, Punjab National Bank, Punjab National Bank, HDFC Mutual Fund, Union Bank, Bajaj Holdings, Avendus Wealth Management, IFFCO Tokyo General insurance, etc.

Equity-oriented mutual fund schemes generated returns of about 25 per cent during the lockdown period amid a recovery in broader markets and liquidity infusion by RBI coupled with the government's stimulus measures, experts said. However, some analysts believe this is nothing more than a bear market rally.Although mutual funds gained from the bounce back from March lows, their long-term returns still look bad, said Vidya Bala, co-founder of PrimeInvestor.in.According to data compiled by Morningstar India, all the equity scheme categories -- equity linked saving scheme ( ELSS ), mid-cap, large and mid-cap, large-cap, small-cap, mid-cap and multi-cap -- have given returns in the range of 23-25 per cent between March 25 and June 3.Individually, large-cap funds have given a return of 25.1 per cent, followed by multi-cap (25 per cent), ELSS as well as large and mid-cap funds (24.9 per cent each), small-cap (24 per cent) and mid-cap (23.2 per cent).Broader markets have recovered 25-30 per cent during the period under review. However, most of the active funds underperformed their respective benchmark indices.The nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of COVID-19 infections started on March 25 and it has been extended by some states till June 30 in the containment zones.Prior to this, all the equity schemes had given negative returns, in the range of (-) 32-37 per cent, since the beginning of the bear market on February 19 to the announcement of lockdown on March 24.Prateek Mehta, co-founder of Scripbox, attributed the positive return by mutual funds to steps taken by the government and central bankers across the globe over the last 12 weeks.""In India, it seems that the market fall has been broken by the RBI rate cuts, extensive government measures and return of the FPIs in May and June,"" he added.Amit Jain, co-founder and CEO at Ashika Wealth Advisors, said this positive return could be due to stimulus packages announced by governments across the globe.During the period under review, Nifty 50 delivered a return of approximately 21 per cent, while equity mutual funds generated 25 per cent due to combination of factors -- liquidity infusion and relaxation of lockdowns across economies -- that buoyed investor sentiments, according to Bajaj Capital Research.""Massive liquidity injections by the RBI in conjunction with the government's stimulus measures (to the tune of approximately 10 per cent of GDP) were aimed at bolstering the economy by mitigating the fallout of the pandemic. The measures buttressed the reinstating of risk-on sentiments,"" it said.In addition, the surge in oil prices by 40 per cent in May after a prolonged hiatus and decline in global infections also helped in improving investors sentiment.However, Bala said, ""We view these as bear rallies, driven by derivatives positions and momentum. Also, inflows from mutual funds helped prevent a slide caused by FPI selling. Less than a fifth of the Nifty 500 stocks have crossed their January highs suggesting narrow rally.""Bear market rally, in market parlance, refers to a short-lived upward trend in prices during a longer-term bear market.Echoing the views, Kaustubh Belapurkar, director - fund research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India, said equity markets rebounded sharply from the lows made in the second half of March and this happens in a bear market rally.Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), which sold significantly in March, have invested money in equities over the last month, he added.Going ahead, Bajaj Capital Research said the rally might not be sustainable as it reflects a dichotomy between real economy and the equity market.""With real economy in doldrums, it will be too optimistic to assume that inflows will continue perennially,"" it added.Belapurkar advised investors to focus on asset allocation and continue with their investments and systematic investment plans (SIPs). If an investor is under-allocated to equities as per his risk profile, he should continue to allocate systematically towards equities, he said.He further said investors should keep at least 7-10 year investment horizon in mind with a volatile asset class like equities.During February 19 to March 24, broader markets plummeted by 35 per cent and equity mutual funds tanked by 37 per cent.The market fall was primarily due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Besides this, the heightened geopolitical risks in the form of US-China tensions exacerbated the already precarious situation. The outbreak of COVID-19 had led to a massive selloff by FPIs in February and March.","""Massive liquidity injections by the RBI in conjunction with the government's stimulus measures (to the tune of approximately 10 per cent of GDP) were aimed at bolstering the economy by mitigating the fallout of the pandemic.

2020-07-01 07:00,2 HDFC funds downgraded,"Himanshu Srivastava is a Research Analyst with Morningstar. He would like to hear from you, but cannot give financial advice.

HDFC Equity and HDFC Top 100 had a good run until the first half of 2019.

Performance tripped in the second half, which eventually dented their long-term track record. As a result, over 5-year and 10-year time frames, the funds have been underperforming their respective benchmarks as well as category peers.

Is the downgrade because of the latest performance numbers? No.

In fact, I would like to point out that this is not the first time HDFC Equity and HDFC Top 100 have witnessed severe underperformance. There were periods in 2013 and 2015 as well. And I remember encountering severe criticism when I reiterated the Gold rating on both funds in 2015.

So what changes now? I see an enhanced risk to the strategy, which leads me to downgrade both to Silver.

Prashant Jain’s long-term investment approach, policy of staying fully invested, and backing his convictions when the strategy is out of favour, has often delivered pleasing results over the long term. But there are also periods when his valuation-conscious approach is out of favour.

Does that mean his approach is faulty?

On the contrary. The process is robust with research at its core. Prashant adopts a hands on approach to research, to get an in-depth understanding of the business and ferret out companies with robust business models, clean balance sheets, and competitive strengths. Though the bottom-up style is clearly integral to Jain’s investment style, the top-down isn’t ignored either.

Since relative and absolute valuation methods are used to pick stocks, his style can be described broadly as growth at a reasonable price.

Given his valuation-conscious approach, Jain increased exposure to segments which are attractively valued, such as financial services, utilities, energy and capital goods. This is consistent with his belief that after a massive sell-off, it’s value which outperforms. He continues to remain underweight on the consumer staples sector given high valuation, and the consumer discretionary space as he believes that COVID-19 will dent demand there. He trimmed exposure to consumer cyclicals to zero much before the segment witnessed a downturn.

The portfolios are poised to benefit from the turnaround in the economic environment, but will continue to witness challenges until the trend reverses. To add to it, his investments in public sector enterprises have not yielded desired results.

A point worth noting is that he has always highlighted the risk inherent to the NBFC segment and has avoided investing in it. To his credit, the events in the NBFC space played out as he anticipated.

For this fund, Prashant is clearly mindful of the benchmark as he targets having “matched stock positions” of at least 60%. Having said that, he doesn’t shy away from taking significant underweight/ overweight positions at the sector level when he spots opportunities. For instance, his top picks such as ICICI Bank, ITC, and Infosys are overweight versus the index.

Prashant isn’t benchmark-conscious while constructing the portfolio.

You are currently investing in a value-oriented scheme, small cap scheme, ELSS fund, and large cap index scheme. Your mutual fund portfolio lacks focus. Based on your risk profile, you should try to invest mostly in an appropriate category. For diversification, you can take a small exposure in some other category, again based on your risk appetite.For this, first you need to define your risk profile sharply. Your stated risk profile is a bit tricky - moderate to aggressive. Only you know what exactly you mean by this risk profile. In our experience, most investors are aggressive in a bull market, and moderate in a bear market.You should find out your risk profile by taking an online quiz. Do not confuse your risk-taking ability with your risk profile. It mostly got to do with your willingness to take risk - how much you are ready to lose and how much volatility can you tolerate.You should always choose mutual funds based on your goals, horizon, and risk. The same applies to Rs 50,000 you want to invest. Is it for long-term? If yes, how long you want to stay invested? How much risk are you willing to take? For example, if you are a bit conservative and looking to invest for seven years, you can choose a large cap fund. If you have a moderate risk appetite, you may choose a multi cap fund. If you have an aggressive risk profile, you can choose mid cap or small cap schemes.What if you want to invest for a short period? You should choose a debt mutual fund based on your investment horizon. For example, if you want to park money for a few weeks, you can choose a liquid scheme. If you want to invest for a few months, you can opt for ultra short duration schemes. If you want to invest for a few years, you should choose a short duration scheme.","Your stated risk profile is a bit tricky - moderate to aggressive.

2020-07-04 07:00,Explained: What are Social Stock Exchanges and how do they work,"With business impacted due to the COVID-19 induced lockdown, Securities and Exchange Board of India constituted panel on social stock exchanges on June 1 had recommended direct listing of non-profit organisations (NPOs) through the issuance of bonds and a range of funding mechanisms in a report submitted to the market regulator.

For submitting public comments on proposal of Social Stock Exchange, SEBI has further extended the date to July 15, which was earlier June 30.

Here is a look at what are SSEs and how they would help the fight against COVID-19.

What is an SSE?

An SSE allows the listing of non-profit or non-government organisations on stock exchanges, providing them with an alternative fund-raising structure. It may be listed on BSE or NSE. Countries like the UK, Canada and Brazil have SSEs.

“The fund-raising is proposed through several instruments such as zero-coupon-zero-principal bonds, social venture funds and mutual funds. The duration of listing of an entity would depend on its objectives and future plans,” Moin Ladha, Partner, Khaitan & Co, said.

What is the size of the market?

India has over 31 lakh NPOs – more than double the number of schools and 250 times the number of government hospitals, which amount to one NPO for 400 Indians.

What are the objectives of SSEs?

According to the draft SEBI report, a Social Stock Exchange may be helpful in rebuilding the livelihoods of people who are affected during pandemics like COVID-19.

“The SSEs will aim at unlocking large pools of social capital, and encourage blended finance structures, so that conventional capital can partner with social capital to address the urgent challenges of COVID-19.”

How will it work and what are the eligibility criteria?

The SSE shall be a separate segment under the existing stock exchanges. It is a set of processes as much as a place. This means that the SSE will not be only a place where securities or other funding structures are “listed” but also a set of procedures that act as a filter, selecting only those entities that are creating measurable positive social impact and reporting such impact.

What instruments will NPOs offer on SSEs?

The Sebi working group report lays out several funding instruments such as zero-coupon-zero-principal bonds, social venture funds, and mutual funds, “providing a wide gamut of options to “donor” investors looking to invest with an objective to create a social impact. This initiative may also enable companies to be able to deploy CSR funding by connecting directly with social organisations,” Ladha said.

Can you give an example?

The Cancer Fund by HDFC Mutual Fund is one example. It operates as a standard mutual fund, with the exception that the returns generated are channelled towards the financing of NPOs. Its investors get their money back from HDFC MF, but any interest or gains that are made are donated to the NPO.

What are the tax benefits?

Investors will get Section 80G benefits which allow all investments in securities/instruments of NPOs listed on SSE to be tax deductible, and corporates to deduct CSR expenditure from their taxable income, among other things. Investment by companies will be considered as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.

What about transparency and reporting standards?

Information Repositories will provide credible, standardised information about the NPOs. IRs are expected to create an appropriate financial reporting standards, so that NPOs can then adhere to them. The new standards are expected to be in place before the end of 2020. Similarly, social auditors will perform an independent verification of impact reporting. While in the immediate term, NPOs need only self-reporting, from the intermediate term onwards, social auditors can take over this function.","For submitting public comments on proposal of Social Stock Exchange, SEBI has further extended the date to July 15, which was earlier June 30.

An equity mutual fund invests mostly in equity or stocks. In India, a mutual fund scheme must invest at least 65% of its corpus in Indian stocks or equity and equity-related investments to be treated as an equity mutual fund for the purpose of taxation . This is the reason why even though international funds invest mostly in stocks, they are not treated as equity mutual funds for taxation. Since they do not invest in Indian stocks, they are taxed like debt schemes.The equity mutual fund has so many categories. As per Sebi norms, there are around 10 equity mutual fund categories. They are:Multi cap funds: These schemes can invest across sectors and market capitalisation like large cap, mid cap, small cap, and so on.Large cap funds: These schemes have the mandate to invest at least 80% of the assets in large cap companies or top 100 companies by market capitalisation.Large & mid cap funds: These schemes have the mandate to invest at least 35% of their assets in large cap stocks, and 35% in mid cap stocks.Mid cap funds: These funds must invest at least 65% of their assets in mid cap stocks, defined as companies that are ranked between 101 and 250 in terms of their market capitalisations.Small cap funds: These funds must invest at least 65% of their assets in stocks of small cap companies, defined as companies that are ranked below 251 in terms of their market capitalisations.Dividend yield fund: These funds have the mandate to invest at least 65% of their assets in dividend yielding stocks.Value Funds: These schemes must invest at least 65% of their assets in stocks based on value investing principles.Contra funds: These funds must follow a contrarian investment strategy and invest 65% of their assets in stocks based on the strategy.Focussed funds: These funds must invest in a portfolio of maximum 30 stocks.

HDFC Medium Term Debt Fund

Most mutual fund managers and advisors have been recommending short-term debt mutual funds for a while now. However, debt mutual funds offer a host of other investment options to conservative investors. One such option is medium duration schemes that investors can use to meet their financial goals of three to four years.As per Sebi categorisation, medium duration schemes must invest in debt and money market instruments with a Macaulay duration of the portfolio between three and four years. However, you should check the portfolio duration of the scheme to ensure that it matches your investment horizon.These schemes have been ignored by advisors and investors in the last two years, as everyone was playing it safe by taking refuge in short term debt funds in an uncertain interest rate environment. In fact, that is why nobody is talking about medium duration funds these days. However, investors with a long investment horizon can consider investing in them. However, investors should be ready to go through the pain of rising interest rates in the interim period.Rising rates are bad news for debt mutual fund schemes, especially the medium- and long-term debt schemes. Long-term bond prices are extremely sensitive to interest rate changes. When the interest rate goes up, the demand for these bonds goes down and their prices fall. Falling bond prices drag down the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these schemes.If you are planning to invest for three to four years and looking for medium duration debt schemes, here are some schemes we have chosen for you. We will update you on the performance of these schemes every month. ETMutualFunds.com has employed the following parameters for shortlisting the debt mutual fund schemes.1.: Rolled daily for the last three years.2.in the last three years: Hurst Exponent, H is used for computing the consistency of a fund. The H exponent is a measure of randomness of NAV series of a fund. Funds with high H tend to exhibit low volatility compared to funds with low H.i) When H equals to 0.5, the series of return is said to be a geometric Brownian time series. These type of time series is difficult to forecast.ii)When H is less than 0.5, the series is said to be mean reverting.iii)When H greater than 0.5, the series is said to be persistent. The larger the value of H, the stronger is the trend of the series3.: We have considered only the negative returns given by the mutual fund scheme for this measure.X equals Returns below zeroY equals Sum of all squares of XZ equals Y/number of days taken for computing the ratioDownside risk equals Square root of Z4.: Fund Return – Benchmark return.

Equity mutual funds in India may witness their first monthly net outflows in more than four years as investors continue to cash out to tide over the pandemic-related credit crunch , while others hold off adding more in a rising stock market Net withdrawals from stock plans may top 10 billion rupees ($134 million) in July, said Nilesh Shah , managing director of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. and chairman of the Association of Mutual Funds in India. That would be the first net outflow since March 2016. AMFI data for July is due early next month.“Some are redeeming to book profits after the rebound and others are selling to meet the cash crunch in their businesses in the absence of bank finance,” Shah said. “Gross flows to equity funds are holding up but there’s no let-up in redemptions. There will be net outflow for July as things stand today.”The contraction in fund flows are a cautionary tale for India’s $1.9 trillion stock market that’s looked past some dire economic projections and climbing virus numbers to jump more than 40% from its March low. Local money managers softened the blow by buying at the depths of the swoon even as foreigners pulled a record $8.4 billion. If the likely outflows in July marks the start of a trend, funds won’t have the same firepower the next time risk appetites dries up.“Since markets have continued to rise this month, I think redemptions will go up,” said Sunil Subramaniam, managing director at Chennai-based Sundaram Asset Management Co. “Some investors are redeeming out of relief as this rally takes more and more of the deep underwater assets back to par value.”With gains of about 9% so far in July, the Sensex is set for a second monthly advance, thanks to flows from overseas funds and participation by a growing contingent of amateur investors. But mutual fund investors aren’t sharing this exuberance.“Since markets have continued to rise this month, I think redemptions will go up,” said Sunil Subramaniam, managing director at Chennai-based Sundaram Asset Management Co. “Some investors are redeeming out of relief as this rally takes more and more of the deep underwater assets back to par value.”With gains of about 9% so far in July, the Sensex is set for a second monthly advance, thanks to flows from overseas funds and participation by a growing contingent of amateur investors.
