Sukuk Prihatin: How you can help Malaysia while earning something for yourself | Malay Mail

KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 20 ― The Malaysian government on Monday launched the Sukuk Prihatin with the target of raising RM500 million to aid the country’s economic recovery amid the Covid-19 pandemic, by opening up an opportunity to Malaysian individuals and companies to invest in the Shariah-compliant investment instrument or Islamic bond through the lending of their money to the government for two years.

Beyond helping with the government’s efforts in rebuilding the economy after the Covid-19 pandemic, Malaysians who choose to put money into Sukuk Prihatin will be able to get back the principal or initial sum at the end of the two years, along with profits at a fixed rate every three months during the two-year period.

Below is a quick highlight and summary of some of the key points in the government’s 61-page knowledge pack on Sukuk Prihatin:

1. What is it?

The government is the issuer of Sukuk Prihatin, which means the government has a direct obligation to the investor for the principal and the profit payments. The Sukuk Prihatin is a one-off issuance by the government.

It is poised as a gateway for Malaysians to unite and join in Malaysia’s economic recovery measures, with the knowledge pack stating: “Themed ‘Forwarding The Nation’s Future Together’ and #KitaUntukKita, the Sukuk Prihatin will carry nationalistic and patriotic elements to rally fellow Malaysians to participate in rebuilding the economy and the nation while enduring Covid-19 crisis.”

2. Who is it for?

To be eligible to invest in Sukuk Prihatin, you have to either be a Malaysian aged at least 18; or a company incorporated in Malaysia; or a cooperative, foundation, sole proprietor, partnership, association or other incorporated bodies operating in Malaysia. A registered trustee can act on behalf of any of the previous three categories, but will not be able to enjoy tax exemptions related to the Sukuk Prihatin.

With Sukuk Prihatin having a short two-year tenure, it is stated to be suitable for investors who “wish to diversify their investment portfolio and are comfortable taking a short-term risk with a minimum return on investments”.

3. How do you apply?

This is Malaysia’s first-ever digital sukuk, which means investors can apply during the subscription period from August 18 to September 17 to invest in Sukuk Prihatin via internet or mobile banking through the JomPAY and DuitNow platforms, depending on the banks involved.

Since Sukuk Prihatin is being offered fully digitally, applications cannot be made over the counter or through the ATM with such applications to be rejected and refunded.

There are 27 participating banks for both corporate and retail investors, with some either offering JomPAY or DuitNow e-channels or both.

Specifically for retail investors, they can subscribe to the sukuk via the internet or mobile banking through their accounts at: Affin Bank, Agrobank, Alliance Bank, Al-Rajhi Bank, AmBank, Bank Islam, Bank Muamalat, CIMB, Hong Leong Bank, Maybank, MBSB, Public Bank, RHB, Bank Rakyat, Bank Simpanan Nasional, Bank of China (Malaysia) Berhad, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC Bank, OCBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, or United Overseas Bank (Malaysia) Berhad.

But applications to subscribe to Sukuk Prihatin will be reviewed to see if all requirements have been met, with applicants to be informed 14 days after the offering period on whether they were successful and with refunds of the money to be done within five days if an applicant is unsuccessful.

4. How much is the minimum and maximum investment amount?

You can apply more than once to invest in Sukuk Prihatin which is on a first-come-first-served basis.

But the condition is that you have to use the same bank account to apply, and with each application to be at least a minimum of RM500 and in multiples of RM100. There is no maximum limit for how much can be invested.

What this means is if you were to apply to invest RM610 in Sukuk Prihatin, RM10 will be refunded to your account within five business days as only multiples of RM100 are allowed.

If you then decide to make another application to invest RM400 or any other amount below RM500, that would not be possible and you will need to top it up to at least RM500 when applying to avoid your application being rejected.

Only applications made from the bank account for the first application will be accepted, while subsequent applications from other bank accounts from the same or different bank will be rejected and refunded.

Make sure you will not need the money that you invested in Sukuk Prihatin for two years, as investors are not allowed to redeem or take the money out before the sukuk’s maturity date and with all such investments required to be held until the end of the two-year period.

You can’t sell off your holding in Sukuk Prihatin or transfer or assign it, which means you have to hold the sukuk which you bought until its maturity date of September 22, 2022.

5.  How much would you get in return for your investment?

At a fixed profit rate of 2 per cent per annum, putting in RM1,000 into Sukuk Prihatin will translate into a RM20 profit per year, which will then be paid to you in four tranches of RM5 for each quarter in a year.

At the same profit rate, putting in RM10,000 would mean a total profit of RM200 per year, which will then be divided into four to be paid to you in sums of RM50 for each quarter or every three months.

If the Sukuk Prihatin’s issue date is September 22, 2020, the first time you will receive your profit payment will be on December 22, 2020.

The government will continue to pay the profit payments to you every quarter until the end of the two-year period for Sukuk Prihatin (September 22, 2022), which will be also when you get your initial investment sum or principal back, unless you choose to donate either all or some of the principal to the government for spending related to Covid-19.

For example, if you decide to waive RM3,000 of your RM10,000 initial investment sum at the end of the two years, you will get RM7,000 back while the RM3,000 will go to a government-approved trust account.

The profit is tax-exempted but you will have to keep the monthly e-statement for Sukuk Prihatin for such purposes, while the waived or contributed amount will be tax-deductible.

You can choose whether to waive your principal when making the application, and can decide in the final quarter whether to change your decision or change the amount you wish to waive or contribute.

6. What will the funds be used for

According to the knowledge pack, the proceeds from Sukuk Prihatin will go to the Kumpulan Wang Covid-19 to fund measures announced in the government’s economic stimulus packages and recovery plan to address the Covid-19 crisis.

Examples of such measures include medical spending related to Covid-19, financing or grants for micro and small and medium enterprises especially women entrepreneurs, , and improving connectivity to rural schools which will act as hubs to connect nearby villages, the government said.

But before actually deciding to invest in Sukuk Prihatin, the first thing you should do is to read the full  and the terms and conditions, and preferably consult professional advisers to evaluate the merits and risks of the investment.

MAS Becomes First Asian Government Entity to Issue RFR Debt

Singapore is seen to be leading Asia in its preparation for the cessation of LIBOR at the end-of 2021. Earlier this month, MAS announced new initiatives to catalyse SORA markets.

MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) auctioned SGD 500 million of six-month notes with a spread over the compounded SORA on Tuesday (18 August), Bloomberg reported.

The move makes MAS the first government entity in Asia to auction notes under a new risk-free rate. Not even the US Treasury has issued debt linked to SOFR, its new risk-free-rate.

Other debt securities have also already been issued off SORA, including floating-rate notes issued by DBS in May, and a SORA-based corporate loan issued by OCBC to property developer CapitaLand in June.

A number of major banks in Singapore including Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank and DBS were also said to be ready to trade SORA derivatives since June.

Singapore is seen to be leading Asia in its preparation for the cessation of LIBOR at the end-of 2021, in part due to its plan for SORA to replace both SOR and SIBOR.

Hong Kong, on the other hand, is adopting a multi-rate approach, where both the risk-free-rate HONIA and HIBOR will coexist.

While the HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) has encouraged banks to issue new HONIA products, there is less incentive to do so because they will still be able to reference HIBOR well beyond 2021.

Earlier this month, MAS announced a number of initiatives aimed at catalysing greater activity in SORA markets, safeguard the benchmark’s integrity and enhance market confidence in SORA.

Among the initiatives, MAS said it would issue SORA-based floating rate notes on a monthly basis, which it said would facilitate the benchmark’s adoption by providing a pricing reference for SORA cash products and spurring hedging activities through the SORA derivatives market.

MAS also said it would publish daily statistics involving SORA; Compounded SORA rates for 1-month, 3-month and 6-month tenors; and a SORA Index that will facilitate calculation of Compounded SORA over specified periods.

S'pore leads global effort to exit Libor with debt sale

Singapore is blazing a trail in the global effort to replace Libor, becoming one of the first countries to auction debt linked to an alternative benchmark.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sold $500 million of six-month notes with a spread over the compounded Singapore Overnight Rate Average (Sora) on Tuesday.

The country is adopting Sora as it moves away from the SGD Swap Offer Rate (SOR), which uses the London interbank offered rate (Libor) in computation.

The move is part of a broader push as policymakers around the world develop new benchmarks to replace Libor by the end of next year, after trading informing the rate dried up and European and US banks were found to have manipulated it for their own gain.

"It's a ground-breaking initiative," said Mr Claude Brown, a partner at Reed Smith in London. "It looks like MAS has already beaten the US Treasury to it."

Hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of global assets are still tied to Libor, from student loans and mortgages to interest-rate swaps and collateralised loan obligations.

Analysts say banks, businesses and other national authorities could follow Singapore's example after the transition lost steam amid the coronavirus pandemic.

"It's a big deal," said Mr John Coleman, senior managing director of the fixed-income group at R.J. O'Brien & Associates in Chicago. "The buy-side community has to adjust. When they see a government going this way, it's no longer a gimmick or something that may go away."

In the US, the Treasury is "very seriously studying the issue", said Mr Jon Hill, US rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets. "I expect them to formally announce SOFR-linked debt this year," he said, referring to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, the Federal Reserve's preferred replacement for dollar Libor.

Asia has lagged behind the rest of the world in preparing for the change but Singapore could offer a regional template for the shift.

A few debt securities have already been issued off Sora, including those from developer CapitaLand and the country's biggest lender, DBS Group Holdings.

Eleven banks, including Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank and DBS Group, are ready to trade Sora derivatives, according to a June statement.

Progress on establishing alternative reference rates across the rest of Asia has been patchy.

In Hong Kong, the Treasury Markets Association has identified the Hong Kong Dollar Overnight Index Average, or Honia, as an alternative rate to the Hong Kong interbank offered rate. The first Honia-linked interest rate swap was centrally cleared last month.

Honia still lacks traction in Hong Kong, partly because banks can continue to reference Hibor for existing and future loan products beyond next year, said Mr Francis Chan, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

Singapore's move "may convince other governments and jurisdictions to look at their own practices", said Mr Jonathan Horan, a partner at Linklaters in Singapore. "Everyone needs to focus on this as the date for Libor discontinuance looms."

Yatırımcılarını ve meraklılarını yakından ilgilendiren altın fiyatları vatandaşlar tarafından devam ediyor. Güncel gelişmelerle beraber altın fiyatları da dalgalanmalar yaşıyor. İşte altında güncel rakamlar…
ALTIN FİYATLARI 19 AĞUSTOS
Gram altın: 460 lira
Çeyrek altın: 764 lira
Yarım altın: 1.531,80 lira
Cumhuriyet altını: 3.053,40 lira
GÜNCEL ALTIN FİYATLARI İÇİN TIKLAYINIZ
“ALTIN FİYATLARINDA YÜKSELİŞ SÜREBİLİR”
Altın fiyatlarında tarihi dalgalanma yaşanıyor. Uluslararası spot piyasada altının ons fiyatı, geçen hafta 2 bin 75 dolarla tüm zamanların rekorunu kırdıktan sonra, dün 1863 dolara kadar gerilemişti. Bugün ise tekrar 1940 doları gördü.
Pandemi döneminde güvenli liman olarak görülen altına talebin artması, merkez banklarının faizleri rekor düşük seviyelere çekip piyasalara daha önce görülmedik düzeyde para sunması ve pandemide ikinci dalga endişeleri, altının ons fiyatının 2 bin doları aşarak rekor kırmasında etkili olmuştu.
Rusya'dan gelen ilk corona virüsü aşısının tescil edildiğine dair haber, ABD tahvil faizlerinin yükselmesi, artan risk iştahı ve kâr realizasyonu için yapılan satışlarla altın fiyatları sert düştü.
RUSYA'DAN GELEN AŞI HABERİ ETKİLEDİ
Bloomberg'ün aktardığına göre, Britanya merkezli Standard Chartered Bank, ABD tahvil faizlerindeki sıçramanın, Rusya'dan gelen aşı haberiyle birlikte salgının kontrol altına alınacağına dair yatırımcı umudunu yansıttığını belirtti.
Hindistan merkezli aracı şirket HDFC Securities'in kıdemli analisti Tapan Patel, “Faizler, fiyatlarda kısa vadede baskı oluşturabilecek ABD destek paketine ilişkin beklentilere bağlı olarak daha da yükselebilir” dedi. Patel, bilançolardaki genişlemenin altına uzun vadede destek sağlamaya devam edeceğine işaret etti.
“KÂR REALİZASYONU OLDU, ARTIŞ SÜREBİLİR”
MineLife Pty. kıdemli analisti Gavin Wendt, “Gerçek tetikleyici dün Rusya'nın Covid-19 aşısı bulduğuna ilişkin haberdi ve bazı yatırımcılar bunu altın pozisyonlarında kârlarını realize etmek ve hisse senetlerine geçmek için kullandılar” dedi.
DoubleLine Capital LP’den Jeffrey Gundlach, altının, geri çekilmeye rağmen yükselişini sürdürmesini beklediğini söyledi. Bank of America da, altının ons fiyatının 3 bin dolar seviyesine ulaşabileceği öngörüsünde bulundu.
Ekonomilerde V şeklinde toparlanma beklentilerinin abartılı olduğunu öne süren Phillip Futures'ın emtiadan sorumlu kıdemli yöneticisi Avtar Sandu, “Altının uzun vadeli temel yönlendiricileri, olumlu kalmaya devam ediyor” değerlendirmesinde bulundu.

The Bank is an active proponent of the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics to better support clients and stakeholders, and doing so in a responsible and trustworthy way that adheres to the pillars of fairness, ethics, transparency and self-accountability.

Sam Kumar, Global Head, Analytics and Data Management, Standard Chartered, said: 'New developments in analytical technology and expanding usage of data require us to fundamentally rethink how we demonstrate ongoing adherence to our pillars and tackle the issue of unjust bias.'

Machine learning, which makes it quicker and easier to analyse large amounts of data and identify patterns and trends, leads to better performance and risk management when used correctly. However, because machine learning models are built using complex automated algorithms, they can act like a black box where it is often challenging for data scientists to explain in detail how decisions are made, and validation of a model's effectiveness can take longer.

Mindful to ensure that data is used ethically, and with a vision to scale up their use of machine learning for core credit decisioning across multiple markets, Standard Chartered presented a challenge to the Truera team, to help create a solution that gives greater insight into the machine learning decision making process, including being able to identify, and therefore mitigate, unjust bias.

Vaman S, Chief Risk Officer, Retail Banking, Standard Chartered, said: 'While there are a number of companies that are exploring the issue of explainability with AI models, we were impressed by the strong academic background of the Truera team and their commitment to helping companies translate responsible AI principles into best practice.'

Truera collaborated closely with the Bank's retail analytics, risk, digital and technology teams on a pilot that focused on one of the Bank's challenger credit decisioning algorithms which uses a combination of traditional data, and with clients' consent, alternative data.

A first for the Bank, the industry leading solution that has been developed works across multiple machine learning platforms and is able to pinpoint the specific variables that influence risk scoring. It also has the ability to look for correlations between seemingly impartial variables that can act as proxies for demographic indicators such as race or gender, which could lead to the introduction of unjust bias resulting in unfair decisions.

The Bank will now work with Truera to further develop the software and explore its application across a range of AI use cases.

Vishu Ramachandran, Group Head, Retail Banking, Standard Chartered, said: 'Ensuring transparency and explainability in AI-based decision making is not just a competitive advantage for us, but also the right thing to do by our clients. Our partnership with Truera will help us better explain and justify our models, support us in building a stronger and more sustainable business as well as give confidence to both customers and regulators in the fairness of our data-driven processes and outcomes.

Anupam Datta, Co-Founder, President, and Chief Scientist, Truera, said: 'We are excited to partner with Standard Chartered to help analyse, improve, and build trust in their AI models with the Truera Model Intelligence Platform. We appreciate the pioneering and leadership role that Standard Chartered is taking with respect to the responsible adoption of AI across all its functions.'

As the use of AI becomes more prevalent, regulators are beginning to issue frameworks around how companies, especially financial institutions, should ensure decisions are fair, ethical, accountable and transparent, with a focus on being able to explain and justify outcomes. Standard Chartered is playing an active role in helping regulators to shape guidelines for responsible use and is a member of the Veritas consortium in Singapore and the Artificial Intelligence Public- Private Forum in the UK.

Teens say no to Samsung's coal project

Young environmental activists in Korea gathered outside Samsung's headquarters in Seoul Wednesday, adding pressure on the electronic giant's construction arm not to participate in a coal plant construction project in Vietnam. 



Samsung C&T is currently considering participation in the Vung Ang 2, a 1,200-megawatt coal power plant construction project in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province. 



"Coal is the biggest contributor to the world's greenhouse gas emissions. If humanity is wiped out from the Earth because of climate change what good would Samsung's quality goods and services be?" Nam Dae-hee, 18, a member of Youth 4 Climate Action in Korea, said during a press conference.



In a letter to Samsung C&T, the young activists argued: "With the help of the Green New Deal, the Korean government pledged to reduce 12.29 million tons of greenhouse gases by 2025. But the coal plant in Vietnam is projected to emit 6.6 million tons every year ― more than 200 million tons in total for the next 30 years. If Samsung C&T decides to participate, it would mean the company has no awareness about climate change and its consequences."



Earlier this week, international environmental groups ran an ad in the Financial Times, a London-based economic daily, pressing the Korean company to stop its pursuit of the coal power project. 



Specialized in power plant construction, Samsung C&T has many projects in and outside Korea. According to its website, it is undertaking power plant projects in the UAE, Singapore and Saudi Arabia. 



A representative from Samsung C&T refused to comment specifically on the environmentalists' actions but said of the company's intentions, "We are only considering participation. We've not decided to participate. This is all we can say now." 



Globally, Samsung has been under growing pressure over its business decisions' potential to pollute and emit greenhouse gases. Last month, Samsung Securities, a financial arm of the group, canceled a coal shipping port construction financing project in Queensland, Australia, in the face of a boycott campaign by local consumers. 



According to eco-business.com, Standard Chartered Bank, OCBD Bank and DBS had been interested in the same project but withdrew from it because of "conflicts with tightened climate policies." 





International environmental activists have come together recently in their campaigns to stop Samsung C&T from participating in the Vietnamese project. The website

is dedicated to this cause, urging visitors to act against Samsung. 



Youth 4 Climate Action has been especially active recently. In May, it successfully influenced the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education to keep its money out of banks involved in coal financing projects. 



Coal is blamed as a major contributing factor to greenhouse gas emissions and aggressive global campaigns are underway to reduce the world's reliance on it. The global trend isn't followed in Korea where coal is still the primary source of energy. Korea is one of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters.

Jio to soon introduce UPI based payments app for entry-level JioPhone

Reliance Jio has been working with NPCI (National Payment Corporation of India) to bring a UPI-based payment system for its JioPhone users. India’s leading telco has now started testing the JioPay app on its 4G-enabled feature phones.

As per this report from BGR, the company is testing the application on 1000 odd JioPhone users as a part of a public trial, ahead of the wider rollout. While this trial started on August 15, Jio has been reportedly working on this for over a year.

The feature, reportedly, only works on the original JioPhone and uses the built-in NFC chip to facilitate tap and pay for contact-less payments to the terminals that use an NFC enabled POS. As per the report, the JioPay app on these 4G-enabled feature phones will offer all the regular features like Add Bank, Scan and Pay, Pay through VPA, Transaction History.

Apart from working closely with NPCI to ensure that the UPI-based payment system works on the KAI OS-powered smartphones, Jio has already collaborated with several banks including - Axis, ICICI, HDFC, Standard Chartered, IndusInd, SBI, Kotak, YesBank, RBL Bank and is said to have got both Debit and Credit cards to work on JioPay for JioPhone.

Apart from making payments to the merchants over the counters, the JioPhone users will also be able to perform other tasks like recharge their phones, transfer payments to their contacts, receive payments and check their account balance.

As per a Counterpoint report, Reliance Jio has over 100 million JioPhone users in the country. While this number includes all the variants of JioPhone, however, even if a fraction of this user base adopts digital payments it could be a major win for Modi Government’s Digital India campaign. 

TechRadar has reached out to Jio representatives to get official details around the wider rollout, we will update this space once we get a response.

APO Group Founder and Chairman Nicolas Pompigne-Mognard to help select Jack Ma Foundation’s Top 10 finalists of Africa’s Business Heroes prize competition

Content provided by APO Group. CNBC Africa provides content from APO Group as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes. CNBC Africa is not responsible for the content provided by APO Group.

The Jack Ma Foundation’s Africa Netpreneur Prize Initiative (ANPI) (https://bit.ly/2M0XmbR) has chosen APO Group (http://www.APO-opa.com) Founder and Chairman Nicolas Pompigne-Mognard as a semi-final judge for this year’s prestigious competition “Africa’s Business Heroes”.

The ANPI organises Africa’s Business Heroes – now in its second year – a grassroot competition looking to spotlight and give a platform to entrepreneurs all over Africa, to showcase their business ideas and inspire others to do so.

The Jack Ma Foundation is committed to fostering African entrepreneurship, and has brought in some of the continent’s most esteemed businesspeople and investors to help the search for Africa’s Business Heroes. Nicolas will be part of a select seven-judge panel who will interview candidates from a semi-final shortlist of 20 entrepreneurs based all over Africa.

In earlier qualification rounds, more than 150 prominent African business leaders acted as initial judges to whittle down more than 20,000 applicants to the final 50.

In the online semi-final, held on August 28th and 29th 2020, Nicolas will help to identify the ten finalists who will go forward to compete in a ‘pitch finale’ in front of Jack Ma himself, among others.

Nicolas has spent more than a decade at the forefront of African business. In 2007, he founded APO Group from his own living room using his own savings, and he has seen it grow into the leading pan-African communications and business consultancy, providing strategic advice to multinational organizations in diverse industries.

Now, in his role as Chairman of APO Group, Nicolas has committed to supporting the next generation of African entrepreneurs. In 2019, he embarked upon a series of conferences in some of Africa’s most prominent universities. He spoke about entrepreneurship, business and journalism to students in Uganda, Zambia, Senegal, Ethiopia, and South Africa.

Nicolas is also a member of several Advisory Boards, including: the African Energy Chamber (https://EnergyChamber.org/), an organization that drives collaboration between African governments and the private sector in all areas of the energy industry; the Africa Hotel Investment Forum (AHIF) (https://www.AHIF.com/), the premier hotel investment conference in Africa; and the EurAfrican Forum (https://www.EurAfricanForum.org/), an action-oriented platform that aims to foster stronger collaboration between Europe and Africa.

The ANPI prize launched last year, and the competition in 2020 is even bigger and better. The prize fund has increased from $1million to $1.5million, with each of the ten finalists receiving a share of it. The value of the Prize goes far beyond mere financial gain, and represents an extraordinary platform where all participants, and not just the winners, have benefited from expertise and insights garnered within the ANPI community of business leaders.

More than 22,000 applicants representing all 54 African countries applied for the chance to be the next African Business Hero – more than double the number of entries in 2019.

In another change from last year, applicants were also able to submit their applications and hold selection interviews in French, a further proof of the inclusive and pan-African spirit of the initiative. As a self-made Franco-Gabonese entrepreneur, Nicolas is well placed to help identify the very best of Francophone African start-ups and innovators.

“Jack Ma is at the very pinnacle of global entrepreneurship, so it is an honour to have been asked to judge this year’s semi-final of the ANPI competition,” said Nicolas Pompigne-Mognard, Founder and Chairman of APO Group. “It is fantastic to see the Jack Ma Foundation investing so much energy into African entrepreneurship, and I am delighted to see such a high level of talent from this year’s applicants as we get ready to crown the next African Business Heroes.”

Le Royaume-Uni ferme une de ses dernières mines mais n'en finit pas avec le charbon

La mine de Bradley, près de Durham (nord de l'Angleterre), a cessé son activité lundi 17 août. Peu de temps avant elle, ce sont celles de Shotton et Brenkley qui ont connu pareil sort. Toutes sont affiliés au même propriétaire, Banks Group, qui déplore « la fermeture de la dernière mine de charbon en Angleterre », et affirme que jusqu'à 250 emplois sont menacés.

La fin de vie de la mine de Bradley a été saluée par les défenseurs de l'environnement après des mois de pressions et des manifestations, notamment de la part d'Extinction Rebellion, pour empêcher le maintien du site jusqu'en 2021 comme l'a demandé en vain Banks Group aux autorités britanniques.

Quelques mines demeurent « au Pays de Galles et en Écosse », fait valoir un porte-parole de Banks Group auprès de l'AFP. Les défenseurs de l'environnement pointent notamment celle de Hartington, également dans le nord de l'Angleterre près de Sheffield, dont l'envergure n'est pas comparable avec les sites de Banks, et quelques petites mines souterraines ailleurs en Angleterre.

C'est néanmoins une page qui se tourne dans un pays où l'extraction de la houille remonte à l'époque romaine et où plusieurs dizaines de sites étaient encore opérationnels au début des années 2000. Face à l'urgence climatique, le Royaume-Uni a décidé l'arrêt définitif du charbon pour produire de l'électricité à horizon 2025. Les centrales utilisant cette ressource s'y comptent désormais sur les doigts d'une main.

« Nous sommes extrêmement proches de la fin du charbon pour produire de l'électricité au Royaume-Uni et la fermeture progressive des centrales thermiques à charbon fonctionne », renchérit Isobel Tarr, l'une des responsables de l'association écologiste Coal Action, interrogée par l'AFP. Toutefois, cela ne concerne pas « le charbon destiné à produire du ciment ou de l'acier et les entreprises (minières) essaient de faire la transition vers ces industries », remarque-t-elle.

Plusieurs projets de nouvelles mines à ciel ouvert sont ainsi en cours de validation par les autorités. Comme celui de Highthorn, également porté par Banks Group. Un autre est combattu vigoureusement par les écologistes à Woodhouse Colliery, dans le comté de Cumbrie au nord-ouest du pays, qui serait la « première mine de charbon en profondeur bâtie en 40 ans au Royaume-Uni ». Le sujet est politiquement chargé, entre les emplois en jeu en pleine récession pour une administration qui a promis un coup de pouce aux régions, et les engagements climatiques du gouvernement, qui vise la neutralité carbone à horizon 2050.

Banks Group fustige des décisions qui traînent et affirme que ne pas autoriser ces chantiers au Royaume-Uni entraîne plus d'importations polluantes de pays lointains comme les États-Unis ou la Russie. Un argument contesté par Paul Etkins, qui fait valoir que les émissions de CO2 dues au transport du charbon sont minimes comparé à celles de sa combustion.

Pour Isobel Tarr, il n'y aura pas de fin du charbon en Grande-Bretagne sans « vision audacieuse pour passer à la production d'acier et de ciment propre et (...) empêcher l'ouverture de nouvelles mines ». Les associations comme Coal Action ou Green Alliance affirment notamment qu'il est possible de produire de l'acier avec moins de charbon, notamment en recyclant l'acier, en modernisant les fonderies pour les rendre plus efficaces en énergie ou grâce à des techniques innovantes utilisant le gaz naturel ou l'hydrogène.

Shareholder returns emerge from Japan as dividends fall elsewhere

Originally written by Richard Aston on What Investment
“Strange times are these in which we live…” so Plato was alleged to have said back in Ancient Greece. One has to wonder what the philosopher would have made of 2020.
So far, we have seen oil prices tank to multi-decade lows, stock markets crash and soar, and central banks once again prop up their respective economies with unprecedented stimulus measures.
If someone had told you about this bizarre reality in the throes of the post-global financial crisis boom, you might not have believed them. Many would have likely raised an eyebrow if the crystal ball predicted that 2020 would see Japan emerge as a shareholder return haven.
Yet, that is exactly what has happened amid the global chaos. What’s more, the Pacific powerhouse’s position as a key income destination only looks set to strengthen as many other regions across the world see dividends wither.
Prudent cash-saving measures?
The global lockdown is putting huge pressure on businesses.
Stocks in almost every sector are reneging on their pre-Covid 19 2020 forecasts. Meanwhile, uncertainty around when normality will resume is casting a big black cloud over their earnings from 2021 onwards.
Firms in the UK, Europe, and the US, are slashing their shareholder returns en-masse in response.
It’s understandable – reduced dividends and share buybacks can provide much-needed balance sheet insulation in tough times. And in what is possibly the strongest indicator of exactly how unusual these times are, we have even seen huge share price gains in response to news of dividend cuts.
But while prudent, these cost-saving measures are also thrusting income investors into unsteady territory. Western regions are losing their status as “income stalwarts” and to the surprise of many, Japan is stepping up to fill the void.
A “cautiously-positive” approach
Readers will be aware of the historically fractured relationship between Japanese companies and their shareholders.
But they will also know of the drive to improve this over the last decade, supported further by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s programme of “Abenomics”.
The leader’s efforts are bearing fruit. The Nikkei dividend index hit a record high in 2019 – its tenth straight annual rise and the seventh year in a row that it has hit an all-time high. Likewise, the year before saw Japanese companies announce an unprecedented $55.6 billion of share buybacks. But dividends and buybacks still fall considerably short of “peacetime” standards in the West.
There is a reason for this. Throughout recent history, Japan has endured its fair share of financial crises and shown itself to be prone to natural disasters and, indeed, epidemics. These circumstances have – unsurprisingly – ingrained a culture of “always being prepared for the unexpected” into the country’s corporate culture.
Although Abenomics is unwinding the extremes of this management style, an air of caution remains – firms like to know they have a cash safety net in place for the bad times. And the benefits of this approach could not be clearer than right now.
Data from Daiwa Securities indicates that aggregate dividends are likely to be flat year-on-year for FY19 and see just a very small decline in FY20. This ability to continue paying out more-or-less as usual stands in stark contrast to the West, where large dividends cuts are a dime a dozen.
Just look at the banking sector. In a massive blow to UK investors, Barclays, Santander, Lloyds, NatWest, Standard Chartered, and HSBC collectively scrapped their 2020 dividends at the beginning of April 2020 on the Bank of England’s request. Meanwhile, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mitsubishi UFJ Holdings – two of Japan’s largest financial institutions – have committed to maintaining dividend levels year-on-year.
Likewise, while dividends have dried up at European telecoms players like Proximus, Telia, and Orange, their Japanese equivalents like NTT, KDDI, and Softbank Corp have announced plans to increase annual payouts.
These are just two examples of a picture that is revealing itself across almost every sector.
Reassessing Japan
Japan’s dividend stability this year should appeal to income-starved investors in a big way. Especially given the likelihood that Western firm will hesitate seriously before reinstating dividends at pre-Covid 19 levels when the time comes.
Against this backdrop, we see Japanese companies continuing to move in the opposite direction.
After all, cutting dividends now would be seen as a huge step backwards. So much so, in fact, that companies have taken a more cautious approach to buybacks and prioritised dividends as their shares have sat at record lows so that they can honour their payout promises.
Given dividends have remained so well covered throughout this year’s pandemic, we expect Japan PLC’s slow-but-steady progress in the shareholder engagement arena to continue well into the future.
In these strange times, investors need to take a step back and reassess their assumptions.
They may find that they have been looking at things from the wrong perspective.

Reliance Jio has been working with NPCI (National Payment Corporation of India) to bring a UPI-based payment system for its JioPhone users. India’s leading telco has now started testing the JioPay app on its 4G-enabled feature phones.

As per this report from BGR, the company is testing the application on 1000 odd JioPhone users as a part of a public trial, ahead of the wider rollout. While this trial started on August 15, Jio has been reportedly working on this for over a year.

The feature, reportedly, only works on the original JioPhone and uses the built-in NFC chip to facilitate tap and pay for contact-less payments to the terminals that use an NFC enabled POS. As per the report, the JioPay app on these 4G-enabled feature phones will offer all the regular features like Add Bank, Scan and Pay, Pay through VPA, Transaction History.

Apart from working closely with NPCI to ensure that the UPI-based payment system works on the KAI OS-powered smartphones, Jio has already collaborated with several banks including - Axis, ICICI, HDFC, Standard Chartered, IndusInd, SBI, Kotak, YesBank, RBL Bank and is said to have got both Debit and Credit cards to work on JioPay for JioPhone.

Apart from making payments to the merchants over the counters, the JioPhone users will also be able to perform other tasks like recharge their phones, transfer payments to their contacts, receive payments and check their account balance.

As per a Counterpoint report, Reliance Jio has over 100 million JioPhone users in the country. While this number includes all the variants of JioPhone, however, even if a fraction of this user base adopts digital payments it could be a major win for Modi Government’s Digital India campaign.

TechRadar has reached out to Jio representatives to get official details around the wider rollout, we will update this space once we get a response.

GSAM partners with Citic Bank for distribution

Goldman Sachs Asset Management has launched the Global Multi-Asset Income Portfolio (GMAI) to retail investors in Hong Kong, according to a statement from the firm. The launch follows after the fund received regulatory approval in May for it to be made available to the public.

The portfolio was incepted in 2015 and has around $88m in assets, according to data from Morningstar.

The offering is a mixed-asset product that invests in global equities and bonds, as well as other non-traditional asset classes, according to its fund factsheet. It aims to provide an income stream with some possibility of capital appreciation, it added.

The Goldman Sachs Global Multi-Asset Income Portfolio, as of end-June 2020

“The addition of GMAI to our product offering reflects investors’ search for income as the low-yield environment is set to continue,” Gladys Chan, head of GSAM’s retail client business in Hong Kong, said in the statement.

Goldman Sachs Asset Management has partnered with China Citic Bank International for the first time to distribute the product. It is also the first bank in the SAR to distribute the fund, the statement said.

China Citic Bank’s funds platform include at least 1,500 investment funds managed by 23 asset managers, according to the bank’s website.

The bank joins a growing list of retail distributors operating in Hong Kong that GSAM has partnered with. They include Citibank, which became a retail partner in May, and HSBC, DBS and Standard Chartered Bank.

While the firm has been working with private banking distributors in Hong Kong for decades, it was only in 2018 when it made its first foray into the territory’s retail market. At the time, made seven mutual funds available to retail investors in Hong Kong.

In total, GSAM has made 11 strategies available to retail investors in the SAR, four of which were approved by the Securities and Futures Commission in May. Besides GMAI, the other funds that received approval earlier this year are the Emerging Markets Multi-Asset Portfolio, the Global Millennials Equity Portfolio and the US Core Equity Portfolio.

While the three funds have been made available to HNWIs via the private banking channel, they haven’t been launched to retail investors in the territory yet, the firm said.

Singapore,United States : Standard Chartered Bank partners with Microsoft to become a cloud-first bank

Standard Chartered Bank and Microsoft Corp. announced a three-year strategic partnership to accelerate the banks digital transformation through a cloud-first strategy. This partnership marks a significant milestone for Standard Chartered in making its vision for virtual banking, next-generation payments, open banking and banking-as-a-service a reality. Leveraging Azure as a preferred cloud platform, the companies will also co-innovate in open banking and real-time payments to help the bank unlock new banking experiences for clients.

Embarking on a cloud-first strategy

As part of its digital transformation, Standard Chartered will adopt a multicloud approach, where significant applications, including its core banking and trading systems and new digital ventures such as virtual banking and banking-as-a-service, will be cloud-based by 2025, subject to regulatory approvals. The bank will also adopt a cloud-first principle for all new software developments and major enhancements.

As technology reshapes the banking industry, Standard Chartered recognizes that a cloud-first strategy is critical to the banks ambition to make banking simpler, faster and more convenient. By being digital-first, the bank will be able to meet the demand for seamless banking virtually anytime, anywhere, and make banking more accessible to people across its network.

Michael Gorriz, Group Chief Information Officer of Standard Chartered, said, Cloud is a cornerstone of Standard Chartereds strategy to meet the present and future banking needs of our clients. Cloud providers have invested massively in the reliability and automation of infrastructure and platforms. Using cloud services improves our ability to be agile and innovative, while increasing our operational efficiency and resilience. As disruption in the financial industry continues, we can focus on client benefits by deploying our solutions quicker and allowing for faster integration of new business models and partners.

The speed and scale of continuous innovation offered by Azure allows us to innovate with the latest AI services to meet evolving client needs. We can pilot new apps in one market and scale them rapidly across others. This is especially important for a bank with a footprint as broad and diverse as ours.

Standard Chartered will adopt Microsoft Azure as a preferred cloud platform to meet the banks need for resilient data centers and cloud services and addressing customers security, privacy and compliance requirements across the banks global footprint.

Co-innovation in open banking application programming interface (API) and Internet-of-Things-based, real-time payments will also help the bank unlock new banking experiences for clients.

Kenyan loans via mobile phones drop 50%, says KCB

Kenya’s KCB Bank says that loans issued via mobile phones almost halved in the first six months of the year, according to Bloomberg.

The data indicates that the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is hitting lower-income earners hardest.

Monthly disbursements by KCB Group averaged KSH 4 billion ($36.9 million) to KSH 5 billion, down from KSH 7 billion to KSH 8 billion before the outbreak.

Additionally, defaults have more than tripled, according to KCB’s chief executive officer, Joshua Oigara.

Many of the bank’s mobile loan customers are from the informal sector. “Because we are not providing any moratorium or extensions to them, then they are facing problems of payment,” says Oigara.

In addition to booking fewer mobile loans, KCB is losing as much as KSH 150 million shillings monthly after the central bank waived costs for many mobile-banking transactions.

Still, the lender forecasts overall loans will grow by about 10% this year, boosted by demand from the manufacturing, transport, trade, retail and construction industries, says Oigara.

Tanzania: Majaliwa - Let's Value Homemade Products

PRIME Minister Kassim Majaliwa has called upon Tanzanians to value homemade goods.

The Premier made the call yesterday in Bagamoyo District, Coast Region when he addressed the management and workers of Bakhresa Sugar Limited (BSL).

"We, Tanzanians, must change our mindsets. We must be patriotic, we must be proud of our homemade goods and we must positively speak on our goods. We must be proud of our skills," Mr Majaliwa insisted.

The prime minister toured BSL site to inspect the ongoing construction of the sugar factory, sugar plantation infrastructures, special laboratory and irrigation infrastructure.

"President John Magufuli has all along been saying Tanzanians are capable of doing good things and today I have personally witnessed that we are indeed able to do good things. The problem is that we don't speak positively on what we do," stated Mr Majaliwa, who went on to query; "Why are we undermining ourselves?"

He, thus, urged Tanzanians to change their mindsets after noting that almost all workers were schooled in domestic colleges such as Kaole Agricultural College in Bagamoyo and Sokoine University of Agriculture.

"We must market, speak positively and feel proud of our country," he insisted.

The PM said President Magufuli's decision to allocate 10,000 hectares of land to establish sugar plantations and the sugar factory aimed at increasing sugar production in the country.

He said the government will continue to create a favourable environment in ending the sugar shortage in the country as the nation still faces shortage of the sweetener.

According to him, the country's shortage of domestic sugar is 70,000 tonnes per year while that of industrial sugar is 165,000 tonnes annually, which isn't produced at all in the country.

He said the country's current total domestic demand of the sweetener stands at 450,000 tonnes while the production capacity in all factories stands at 380,000 tonnes.

Apart from TPC, Kagera, Mtibwa, Kilombero, Manyara and Bagamoyo, there is still available land for sugar plantations in Tarime and Kigoma, inviting more investors to explore the opportunities.

"It's our plan to stop importing sugar and start producing it on our own and it will be of high quality," he said, commending Bakhresa Group of Companies for the investment that has also created employment opportunities for Tanzanians.

Speaking of the project, Mr Majaliwa noted its completion would enable the country to tackle shortage of sugar and that it would assure a market of sugar cane being produced by local farmers surrounding the project area.

He also instructed the agriculture officers to continue issuing public education on the importance of investing in sugarcane production as there is a reliable market.

Earlier, the Director General of Bakhresa group of Companies, Mr Abubakar Bakhresa reiterated their commitment to continue complementing the government's move to address the shortage of sugar in the country.

Mr Bakhresa said the project cost 100million US dollars and that so far they have managed to mobilise 70 per cent of the total budget.

The fund has been mobilised from various sources including bank loans and from within the Bakhresa Group of Companies.

According to him they have borrowed 6.5million US dollar the Tanzania Agriculture Development Bank (TADB), CRDB Bank (25million US dollars), Standard Chartered Bank (10US million dollars) while the 30 US million dollars are from within the Bakhresa group.

In another development, Prime Minister Majaliwa has challenged graduates to be creative by coming up with different ideas that can earn them money, instead of waiting for white collar jobs.

He said, instead of waiting for employment from the formal sector, it's high time for graduates to change their mindsets and venture into self-employment where there was great potential.

The Premier made the statement on Monday when addressing a senate of graduates from Dar es Salaam based universities in an event that was held at the Karimjee Hall in the city.

"Let's try to do away with the mentality that white collar jobs are the only form of work that graduates have to do. It isn't easy for all graduates to be accommodated in the formal sector, we have to accept the reality that you can earn your living from any legal activity," said Mr Majaliwa.

He also explained that the government has managed to improve educational infrastructures by renovating schools, colleges and universities for them to cope with the current demand.

"To address shelter challenges for university students in Dar es Salaam, the government had released its houses in Kigamboni and Kijichi to be used as hostels," he said.

Ex-Nakumatt CEO loses Sh2bn assets to Bank of Africa

Former Nakumatt Supermarket CEO Atul Shah has failed to stop Bank of Africa from auctioning his personal property worth Sh2 billion over loans offered to the collapsed retailer. The bank is the first to seize assets linked to Mr Shah after the creditors vowed to attach assets owned by him and his family to recover billions of shillings lent to Nakumatt. The High Court has given Bank of Africa the nod to auction the property, registered under the name of Collogne Investments on August 24 to recover Sh700 million advanced to the collapsed retail chain. Collogne Investments is owned by Mr Shah. Nakumatt closed shop in January with debts estimated at Sh30 billion -- including Sh18 billion to suppliers, Sh4 billion to commercial paper holders and the rest to banks. The banks have been more aggressive in pursuing their unpaid loans, with assets worth Sh3.68 billion linked to Mr Shah and his family targeted for seizure. Justice Mary Kasango dismissed an application by Collogne Investments to stop the auction by Bank of Africa. Collogne Investments argued that the property was used as security for other loans and that it would lose office space if the auction were allowed to proceed. The company told the court the forced sale of the office block in Nairobi’s Industrial Area will expose it to legal suits from third parties who have rented space in the property. Nakumatt tapped several loans from Bank of Africa between 2013 and 2015 when it was struggling to settle suppliers’ dues before it was brought down by poor management and rapid debt-fuelled expansion. “Bearing what is before me I am of the view that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that its appeal is not frivolous and I do find that the defendant bank stands to suffer greater hardship if an injunction is granted since the debt is not being serviced,” Justice Mary Kasango said. Bank of Africa told the court that the auction was lawful, arguing that the directors of Nakumatt were not protected by the retail
chain’s insolvency. Creditors of the supermarket chain on January 7 voted to wind it up after it failed to repay debts following a failed rescue attempt. After the vote, the banks started to identify properties and bank accounts linked to Mr Shah, especially outside Kenya, with a view to seizing and recovering billions of shillings the lenders are owed. The local assets include shopping malls, office blocks and prime land in Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru — where Atul’s father started Nakumatt as a retail shop. The properties are owned by third parties linked to the Shah family, which owns the bulk of Nakumatt shares, according to a document prepared by the retail chain’s court-appointed administrator. Meanwhile, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations’ anti-banking fraud unit is investigating Nakumatt over alleged theft and money laundering. That means Mr Shah risks both criminal and civil proceedings over the collapse of retail chain should the creditors push for court action after the two investigations. Nakumatt Holdings had lent its directors more than Sh1 billion in interest-free soft loans by the time it was placed under administration on January 22, 2018, according to a review of the company’s financial statements. The related party transactions were recently disclosed in a report for the year ended February 2018 by Parker Randall Eastern Africa, the retailer’s independent auditor. Although the auditor did not specify which individuals owed the company the money, Nakumatt had only two directors — Mr Shah and his son. The amounts owed by insiders, which did not attract interest charges, had dropped to Sh948 million as of February 2018, the period for which the latest financial records are available. Regulatory documents said Mr Shah had acknowledged receiving the soft loans and informed the administrator that he had no cash, arguing he was distressed. A document from the administrator has listed properties that include a Sh2 billion property in Nairobi owned
by Collogne, Park View Shopping Arcade worth Sh600 million, a Sh220 million plot in Westland under Nakumatt Investments, an office block valued at Sh350 million in Mombasa and River View Plaza, which is worth Sh200 million. “Banks will now go after guarantors some of which are Nakumatt sister companies. The guys who will walk home with zero are the commercial paper holders,” said Pater Kahi, who was appointed as Nakumatt administrator in 2018. “DTB is owed Sh3.6 billion, Standard Chartered Sh900 million, KCB Sh1.9 billion, Bank of Africa Sh328 million, UBA Sh126 million and GT Bank Sh104 million.” In its heyday, the retailer, which started off Nakuru Mattresses, had more than 60 outlets across Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. However, its financial problems led to empty shelves and store closures that eventually culminated in the demise of the once leading supermarket chain. Foreign investors could have helped overhaul management and inject cash. But despite a swarm of suitors, no deal was made in the end.

India takes on Asia's foreign exchange hubs for rupee trade with GIFT City

India’s only international financial hub is seeking to seize a major part of the offshore trading business within two years, a target that is both ambitious as well as crucial for its plan to be an alternative global financial gateway.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to pitch India as a new Asian destination for global fund flows rivaling the likes of Singapore and The move comes amid Bejing’s muscle-flexing in through a new national security law that threatens to undermine the city’s role as a regional financial center.

“One of the key elements that work in our favor is that there is overall stability in India,” Tapan Ray, managing director and group chief executive of Gujarat International Financial Tech City, wrote in an email interview. “There is predictability in policy.”

The centerpiece of Modi’s pet project, conceived when he was chief minister of Gujarat state, offers flexibility in financial transactions with lower taxes and easier regulations than elsewhere in the country. India’s policymakers have been increasingly concerned about the growing heft of the trades in venues overseas, and as the hub is known, seeks to fill that gap.

The hub offers trading in equities, currencies and commodities, as well as listing of international bonds. Exchanges located there started trading derivatives settled in foreign currencies in May. Subsequently, banks who had units in the hub were allowed by the central bank to trade in offshore FX markets.

Yet, going by current numbers, GIFT City’s targets looks aspirational. A hub like Singapore offers an investor access to all major currencies and more counter parties.

The average daily volume for the rupee in London totaled $47 billion in April 2019, while that in Singapore was nearly at $20 billion, according to the latest data from the Bank for International Settlements. In contrast, total rupee derivative volumes over a month at stood at about $6 billion.

Standard Chartered Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc and other U.S.-based banks have either set up or are in the process of building their operations in GIFT City, according to Ray.

Other lenders from the U.S., Japan and Europe are also actively considering setting up units, he said. Developing local clearing for foreign currencies trading is also on the agenda, and a new mechanism for real-time settlement of transactions should be in place soon, he said.

India takes on Asia’s forex hubs for major share of rupee trade

India’s only international financial hub is seeking to seize a major part of the offshore rupee trading business within two years, a target that is both ambitious as well as crucial for its plan to be an alternative global financial gateway.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to pitch India as a new Asian destination for global fund flows rivalling the likes of Singapore and Hong Kong. The move comes amid Bejing’s muscle-flexing in Hong Kong through a new national security law that threatens to undermine the city’s role as a regional financial centre.
“One of the key elements that work in our favour is that there is overall stability in India,” Tapan Ray, Managing Director and Group Chief Executive of Gujarat International Financial Tech City, wrote in an email interview. “There is predictability in policy.”
The centre-piece of Modi’s pet project, conceived when he was chief minister of Gujarat state, offers flexibility in financial transactions with lower taxes and easier regulations than elsewhere in the country. India’s policymakers have been increasingly concerned about the growing heft of the rupee trades in venues overseas, and GIFT City as the hub is known, seeks to fill that gap.
The hub offers trading in equities, currencies and commodities, as well as listing of international bonds. Exchanges located there started trading rupee derivatives settled in foreign currencies in May. Subsequently, banks that had units in the hub were allowed by the central bank to trade in offshore foreign exchange (FX) markets.
Tough rivals
Yet, going by current numbers, GIFT City’s targets looks aspirational. A hub like Singapore offers an investor access to all major currencies and more counter parties.
The average daily volume for the rupee in London totalled $47 billion in April 2019, while that in Singapore was nearly at $20 billion, according to the latest data from the Bank for International Settlements. In contrast, total rupee derivative volumes over a month at GIFT City stood at about $6 billion.
Standard Chartered Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc and other US-based banks have either set up or are in the process of building their operations in GIFT City, according to Ray.
Other lenders from the US, Japan and Europe are also actively considering setting up units, he said. Developing local clearing for foreign currencies trading is also on the agenda, and a new mechanism for real-time settlement of transactions should be in place soon, he said.
However, sceptics say it will take more than cost advantages to bring investors to GIFT City.
“If I was a hedge fund operating out of Singapore or in Hong Kong, then I know in the back of my mind that effectively GIFT is under India even though it is an international jurisdiction,” said Ananth Narayan, a professor of finance and former South Asia head of financial markets at Standard Chartered. “Which means Indian regulators would have access to what I am doing.”

Ex-Nakumatt CEO loses Sh2bn assets to Bank of Africa

Ex-Nakumatt CEO loses Sh2bn assets to Bank of Africa

Former Nakumatt Supermarket CEO Atul Shah has failed to stop Bank of Africa from auctioning his personal property worth Sh2 billion over loans offered to the collapsed retailer.

The bank is the first to seize assets linked to Mr Shah after the creditors vowed to attach assets owned by him and his family to recover billions of shillings lent to Nakumatt.

The High Court has given Bank of Africa the nod to auction the property, registered under the name of Collogne Investments on August 24 to recover Sh700 million advanced to the collapsed retail chain.

Collogne Investments is owned by Mr Shah.

Nakumatt closed shop in January with debts estimated at Sh30 billion -- including Sh18 billion to suppliers, Sh4 billion to commercial paper holders and the rest to banks. The banks have been more aggressive in pursuing their unpaid loans, with assets worth Sh3.68 billion linked to Mr Shah and his family targeted for seizure.



Justice Mary Kasango dismissed an application by Collogne Investments to stop the auction by Bank of Africa. Collogne Investments argued that the property was used as security for other loans and that it would lose office space if the auction were allowed to proceed.

The company told the court the forced sale of the office block in Nairobi’s Industrial Area will expose it to legal suits from third parties who have rented space in the property.

Nakumatt tapped several loans from Bank of Africa between 2013 and 2015 when it was struggling to settle suppliers’ dues before it was brought down by poor management and rapid debt-fuelled expansion.

“Bearing what is before me I am of the view that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that its appeal is not frivolous and I do find that the defendant bank stands to suffer greater hardship if an injunction is granted since the debt is not being serviced,” Justice Mary Kasango said.

Bank of Africa told the court that the auction was lawful, arguing that the directors of Nakumatt were not protected by the retail chain’s insolvency.

Creditors of the supermarket chain on January 7 voted to wind it up after it failed to repay debts following a failed rescue attempt.

After the vote, the banks started to identify properties and bank accounts linked to Mr Shah, especially outside Kenya, with a view to seizing and recovering billions of shillings the lenders are owed.

The local assets include shopping malls, office blocks and prime land in Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru — where Atul’s father started Nakumatt as a retail shop. The properties are owned by third parties linked to the Shah family, which owns the bulk of Nakumatt shares, according to a document prepared by the retail chain’s court-appointed administrator.

Meanwhile, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations’ anti-banking fraud unit is investigating Nakumatt over alleged theft and money laundering.

That means Mr Shah risks both criminal and civil proceedings over the collapse of retail chain should the creditors push for court action after the two investigations.

Nakumatt Holdings had lent its directors more than Sh1 billion in interest-free soft loans by the time it was placed under administration on January 22, 2018, according to a review of the company’s financial statements.

The related party transactions were recently disclosed in a report for the year ended February 2018 by Parker Randall Eastern Africa, the retailer’s independent auditor.

Although the auditor did not specify which individuals owed the company the money, Nakumatt had only two directors — Mr Shah and his son.

The amounts owed by insiders, which did not attract interest charges, had dropped to Sh948 million as of February 2018, the period for which the latest financial records are available. Regulatory documents said Mr Shah had acknowledged receiving the soft loans and informed the administrator that he had no cash, arguing he was distressed.

A document from the administrator has listed properties that include a Sh2 billion property in Nairobi owned by Collogne, Park View Shopping Arcade worth Sh600 million, a Sh220 million plot in Westland under Nakumatt Investments, an office block valued at Sh350 million in Mombasa and River View Plaza, which is worth Sh200 million.

“Banks will now go after guarantors some of which are Nakumatt sister companies. The guys who will walk home with zero are the commercial paper holders,” said Pater Kahi, who was appointed as Nakumatt administrator in 2018.

“DTB is owed Sh3.6 billion, Standard Chartered Sh900 million, KCB Sh1.9 billion, Bank of Africa Sh328 million, UBA Sh126 million and GT Bank Sh104 million.”

In its heyday, the retailer, which started off Nakuru Mattresses, had more than 60 outlets across Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. However, its financial problems led to empty shelves and store closures that eventually culminated in the demise of the once leading supermarket chain.

Foreign investors could have helped overhaul management and inject cash. But despite a swarm of suitors, no deal was made in the end.

Reliance Jio Phone users can now make payments through Jio Pay: All you need to know

Reliance Jio is testing its own payments app in India. As per the latest reports, Reliance is testing the Jio Pay in over a thousand Jio Phones. The company has plans to roll out the feature for a wider audience soon. It was earlier being reported that Jio is working with National Payments Corporation of India to make its payments system available to over 388 million Jio Phone users in India.

As per a report by BGR, Reliance Jio has rolled out the Jio Pay in a testing phase to several Jio Phone uses across India. The report reveals that the feature was being tested by the company for over a year now but the feature was only rolled out to the Jio Phone users on August 15. BGR had obtained the exclusive pictures of the Jio Pay app on Jio Phone which shows that the application is compatible with UPI, which means that it can process UPI-enabled payments. The users have also told the daily that “UPI supports complete features including Add Bank, Scan and Pay, Pay through VPA, Transaction History.”

In the leaked images, one can see that Jio Pay also has Paytm like features including the Tap and Pay, Send Money via UPI, Jio Recharge. The users can also add multiple accounts to make transactions possible and a “History” option can also be seen in the Jio Pay menu, which in all likelihood would show all the transactions made by the user.

The report further reveals that the Jio Pay supports NFC and hence users can make contactless payments simply by tapping on a compatible device, which could be done due to the presence of NFC enabled POS machine installed in the app. The telecom giant so far has partnered with banks including Axis, ICICI, HDFC, Standard Chartered, IndusInd, SBI, Kotak, YesBank and RBL Bank to make payments possible on Jio Pay.

Reliance has successfully tested the Jio Pay feature on Jio Phone and one can now expect a wider rollout. Notably, only the Jio Phone users have got the feature till now, Jio Phone 2 users are yet to get the Jio Pay on their devices.

On a related note, Reliance Jio will let users live stream IPL 2020. However, there is catch, only the subscribers who have access to Disney+ Hotstar will be able to live stream the upcoming Indian Premiere League.

Intellasia East Asia News - US sanctions will make everyday life a headache for HK's political leaders and their families, from closed accounts to blocked payments

Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Yuet-ngor and other officials sanctioned by the US government over a national security law are clinging to the premise that the measures will be harmless because they do not have American bank accounts or own property in the United States.

But, the long reach of the American government and the dominance of the US dollar as a trade currency could throw up an array of unexpected barriers for so-called specially designated nationals (SDNs), according to former American officials and compliance lawyers.

Sanctioned individuals and in some cases their close family members could find overseas bank accounts closed, bank-issued credit cards cancelled and insurance coverage put on hold by financial institutions wary of running afoul of US regulators and losing access to the American financial system, compliance officials said.

Get the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.

Transactions with US companies, including ordering from American websites such as Amazon.com, are likely to be blocked and even booking a staycation at a US-owned hotel chain could prove difficult, if not impossible, depending on how the company’s foreign subsidiaries are structured, said Julia Friedlander, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.

“What that does is pushes an individual out of the US dollar system,” Friedlander, a former senior policy adviser in the US Treasury Department’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said. “If they want to conduct payments, they’re going to have to do so using financial institutions that are cut off from the US financial system and largely will not transact in dollars.”

On August 8, the US Treasury Department sanctioned 11 Hong Kong and mainland officials, including Lam, the current and former police commissioners and the head of Beijing’s local liaison office, over the implementation of the national security law, which American officials claim undermines the city’s autonomy and could curb freedom in the city. They also barred those officials and close family members from travelling to the US.

The Hong Kong sanctions followed a July 14 executive order by US President Donald Trump and the passage of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which would allow the US to sanction foreign banks and other financial institutions who engage in “significant” transactions with individuals deemed to have contributed to the erosion of the city’s autonomy.

“Sanctions like these, while they of course carry a very heavy dose of symbolism, they also have some pretty practical impacts from a financial standpoint,” said Scott Flicker, the chair of Paul Hastings’ Washington office and leader of the law firm’s global trade controls practice. “You don’t need to be present in the United States and you don’t need to be dealing specifically with a US financial institution to be affected.”

Violating sanctions can be costly for financial institutions and other companies that breach US sanctions, even if inadvertently.

For example, American Express agreed to pay $204,000 to the US three years ago after a Belgian credit-card issuer processed more than 1,800 transactions in violation of sanctions against Cuba. Amex owned a 50 per cent stake in the Belgian firm’s parent company.

The Hong Kong sanctions are being administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an arm of the Treasury Department. Over seven decades, the office has overseen sanctions against Cuba, Iran and North Korea and Russia.

OFAC regulations prohibit US persons and entities from providing goods or services with sanctioned individuals, entities or countries and property or assets held by those facing US sanctions are subject to freezing and potential seizure.

Depending on the sanctions programme, special licenses are required for a US citizen to meet with a SDN or for a sanctioned foreign leader to stay at a US-owned hotel overseas.

While there is a process to appeal a sanction designation, being removed from a sanctions list is difficult, lawyers said. The designations stem from the president’s executive power under the US Constitution, they said.

For the most part, Hong Kong and mainland officials have mocked the measures.

Lam said in a television interview last month that she had no assets in the United States and “I don’t particularly like going to the US”, while Luo Huining, director of Beijing’s liaison office in the city, sarcastically offered on August 8 to send $100 to US President Donald Trump, so that it could be frozen.

To be sure, sanctioned individuals are less likely to struggle if they do not hold assets in the US and make most of their transactions in currencies other than the US dollar, such as the yuan.

The challenge, however, comes if their financial institution needs to access the US financial system regularly.

Following a series of multibillion-dollar settlements with American authorities over anti-money-laundering and sanctions breaches, banks and other financial institutions are much more cautious when it comes to doing business with so-called politically exposed persons. That includes individuals the US has not sanctioned.

As a result, financial institutions are severing ties with foreign individuals who are more likely to come under American scrutiny, as well as US clients in some cases, to avoid falling under the purview of US authorities.

“Many banks take a highly risk averse approach to these issues,” said Adam Ferguson, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland in Hong Kong.

Bernard Chan, convenor of the Executive Council, said he had one of his US bank accounts closed in March unrelated to sanctions, after the lender learned of his political role in the city. Chan is one of only two members of Lam’s de facto cabinet who have declared American assets.

“After the news of my account being closed in the US, I’ve been approached by other banks in Hong Kong, including a US bank, to open an account with them in Hong Kong,” Chan said. “But I’ve enough bank accounts already and l don’t need any more.”

Chan, who is not facing sanctions, did not name the bank that closed his account. He has another account in the US that remains open.

Even ahead of the US sanctions, global banks in Hong Kong were quietly reviewing their client lists for people at risk, according to people familiar with their thinking.

Two of the city’s three currency-issuing banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, have paid a combined $4 billion since 2012 and reached agreements with US authorities to avoid criminal prosecution for past failures in their anti-money-laundering and sanctions control programmes.

In recent days, Citigroup took steps to suspend credit-card accounts associated with some of the individuals facing US sanctions, according to a person familiar with the moves but not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.

Bloomberg reported on August 12 that the Hong Kong arms of some Chinese state-owned banks, including Bank of China (Hong Kong), are being cautious about opening new accounts for individuals facing sanctions.

Spokespersons at Citigroup, HSBC and Standard Chartered all declined to comment for this story, while Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment.

The credit union for the city’s police force began moving about HK$11 billion in assets from foreign banks to China-based lenders in May over concerns about potential sanctions.

Rising tensions between the US and China threatens to trap financial institutions between the two superpowers.

Trump’s executive order prohibits “the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked” by the sanctions. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act separately includes a provision that subjects banks who engage in “significant” transactions with blocked persons to sanctions themselves.

At the same time, Article 29 of the city’s national security law prohibits the imposition of sanctions, blockades or other hostile actions against Hong Kong or the mainland potentially putting banks in a bind if they abide by the US decrees.

Bankers are reluctant to discuss publicly how they will address any potential clash, saying privately they would look to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city’s de facto central bank, for guidance on how to proceed regarding their Hong Kong business. “With respect to the various laws that exist and the potential conflicts between those laws, we follow the laws and regulations of all of the countries in which we operate and will continue to do that,” Noel Quinn, HSBC’s chief executive, said on a conference call with journalists on August 3. “It would be wrong of me to speculate on any potential conflicts between different laws between the US and China.”

The HKMA said on August 8 that unilateral sanctions by foreign governments are “not part of the international targeted financial sanctions regime and have no legal status in Hong Kong”, sparking confusion among some bankers.

At the same time, businesses and other entities with ties to sanctioned individuals could face their own challenges under US sanctions. Related companies in which a sanctioned individual owns 50 per cent or more can be blocked from engaging in transactions in the American financial system.

The US placed Arkady Rotenberg, a Russian businessperson and a former judo partner of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and his brother Boris Rotenberg under sanctions in 2014, but Arkady Rotenberg transferred part of his business to his son Igor in an attempt to avoid sanctions. The US placed Igor Rotenberg under sanctions four years later.

One Hong Kong company already took steps last week to reduce its potential exposure because of family ties.

Engineering firm Analogue Holdings issued a statement on August 9 that Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, the city’s Secretary for Justice and wife of Analogue’s chair, did not have an interest in the company and no rights to the shares held by her husband. She is one of the 11 officials sanctioned by the US government.

The next day, Analogue announced it had reduced its interest in New York-based Transel Elevator & Electric because of US-China tensions and no longer held a controlling stake in the American company.

Sanctioned individuals acting as signatories on contracts, such as a contract with the Hong Kong government, also can prove problematic for companies and lead to penalties.

For example, OFAC fined Exxon $2 million in 2017, claiming agreements the energy giant signed with Russian oil company Roseft violated US sanctions because the signer of the contracts, Rosneft’s president, was facing sanctions himself. A federal court vacated the penalty in December after a lengthy court fight.

Enhanced enforcement by the US in recent years is increasingly causing banks to shy away from business, even if it is technically legal, over concerns about the potential for enhanced compliance risk later, Flicker, the Paul Hastings lawyer, said.

“If you are a person on the OFAC SDN list, it is a near certainty that you’re going to face difficulty in opening bank accounts or conducting bank transactions with global financial institutions that may be in that de-risking mode,” Flicker said.

High yields can’t stop global fund exodus from Indian bonds

MUMBAI (Aug 18): Global funds used to clamor for more access to India’s debt markets. The high-yielding bonds are now the least popular in Asia as the nation struggles to contain the coronavirus pandemic.

Overseas funds have sold US$14.6 billion of Indian corporate and government bonds this year, the most among emerging-Asian nations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Indonesia has also seen outflows, but almost half that of India, while South Korea and Malaysia have attracted inflows.

“Foreigners were already looking at India with caution given the worries over higher fiscal deficit,” said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a rates strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “Covid-led risk aversion accelerated the outflows.”

Global funds own just about 1.5% of the local debt, compared to about 30% in Indonesia. Still foreigners could be an important source of demand for sovereign debt amid a supply glut as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government plans to sell a record 12 trillion rupees (US$160 billion) of bonds this fiscal year.

India took steps to further open up the domestic bond market to foreign investors in late March, allowing them unrestricted access on certain bonds, with an eye on inclusion in global indexes. However, there have been just around 228.8 billion rupees of inflows in this segment since then.

Headwinds for the bond market are growing with India’s Covid-19 death toll rising to the fourth-largest globally, with the total number of confirmed cases at more than 2.6 million. That’s expected to put a damper on India’s growth, with the IMF forecasting it to be one of the worst-performing major emerging economies this year.

The prospect of a prolonged central bank pause amid rising inflation is further reducing the appeal of Indian debt. The situation in government bonds is particularly dire, with foreign holdings plunging to 934 billion rupees, near a record low reached in June.

“In the near-term, the INR government debt market is likely to be driven by higher-than-expected inflation and expectations over whether there would be further RBI support for bonds.” Joevin Teo, Head of Asian Fixed Income, Amundi Singapore Ltd said.

For the first time in almost a year, underwriters stepped in to help push a 10-year sovereign bond sale over the line on Friday, in a sign of flagging domestic demand for the debt. Concerns of an increase in sovereign borrowing have also taken hold after the RBI’s lower-than-expected dividend payout to the government.

The strains are evident in the nation’s 10-year bond yield, which has risen to 5.95%, the third-highest in Asia.

“Unless there is a big improvement toward emerging market local currency assets, it is difficult to see significant moves into the Indian market in the near term,” said Manu George, Managing Director and senior fixed-income strategist at TCW Singapore Asset Management Pte.

Gertrudes Hospital borrows Sh200m from StanChart for Covid war

Gertrudes Hospital has borrowed Sh200 million from Standard Chartered Bank of Kenya #ticker:SCBK to fund its operations in the wake of the disruptive Covid-19 pandemic.

The hospital’s chief executive Robert Nyarango said the pandemic has put much pressure on hospitals and the loan will provide cash flow to meet needs such as protective equipment for doctors and also pay additional staff.

“We have had to increase our staffing to ensure that there is an adequate pre-screening process for patient safety and to identify potential Covid-19 cases prior to entrance to the facility,” said Dr Nyarango.

“This means additional investments in the necessary equipment and we are grateful to StanChart for extending the credit facility at a competitive rate.”

The loan attracts a one-off interest of nine percent as opposed to the traditional loans which accumulate interest per month.



Currently, the average price of loans in the banking sector is about 12 percent.

“This has been of great benefit to us considering the cash outlays required at this time of Covid-19 with a plunge in business and capital required to meet Ministry of Health guidelines for patient safety,” said Dr Nyarango.

The loan is part of the global Standard Chartered’s Sh107 billion ($1 billion) kitty that targets companies that provide goods and services for fighting Covid-19.

StanChart Kenya says it has also given Sh450 million commitments to other firms but the amount is yet to be drawn.

Operations such as hospitals have had to make additional investments in equipment and consumables such as masks and gloves to reduce risk of infections in their facilities.

The number of patients visiting hospitals has also dropped due to financial difficulties and the fear of contracting the virus, leading to reduced revenue in some facilities.

StanChart head of global banking in Kenya and East Africa, Birju Sanghrajka, said the bank stands to help hospitals and other businesses deal with financial strains that set in after Covid-19 disruptions.

Hong Kong's police chief shifted his mortgage to Bank of China (Hong Kong) from HSBC just days ahead of US sanctions

Hong Kong's police chief, among 11 officials sanctioned by the United States government over China's national security law for the city, shifted his mortgage from HSBC to Bank of China (Hong Kong) days before the US enacted its policy, according to public records.
Commissioner of Police Chris Tang Ping-keung transferred the mortgage for his 439-square foot (41-square metre) flat on August 4, three days before US sanctions were announced, according to the Land Registry's records. He bought the flat at Chi Fu Fa Yuen in Pok Fu Lam in March 2017 for HK$6.25 million (US$806,000).
The flat is for the police chief's "self-use, and the use of banking services is purely a personal consumer choice that is not related to any sanction," the Hong Kong Police Force's public relations branch said in response to inquiry by South China Morning Post.
Still, the transfer underscores how US sanctions can make day-to-day life more difficult for so-called specially designated nationals and their families, as American banks and other lenders who want to continue to access the US financial system close bank accounts and cancel credit cards. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said she's having difficulty using her credit cards, an inconvenience that she described as "meaningless" in her interview with Chinese state television.

US President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act into law last month, giving American regulators the ability to sanction non-US banks who engage in "significant" transactions with individuals who helped end the city's "high degree of autonomy" from mainland China.
The law did not specify what constitutes a significant transaction and bankers and other financial professionals in the city are hoping the issue will soon be clarified, according to compliance lawyers.
"Financial institutions in Hong Kong are watching very closely for further guidance from the US Treasury Department on the definition of a significant transaction for the purposes of Hong Kong sanctions," said Nicholas Turner, a lawyer with Steptoe  Johnson in Hong Kong who specialises in economic sanctions.
Chinese-language newspaper HK01 first reported on its website Tuesday that Tang moved his mortgage. A HSBC spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the bank does not discuss individual clients. Bank of China (Hong Kong), one of the city's three currency-issuing banks along with HSBC and Standard Chartered, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
"The commissioner reiterated that it is his responsibility and honour to maintain national security and the security of Hong Kong, and that foreign sanctions are meaningless to him," Hong Kong's police said in its statement. "He will continue to concentrate on the work of safeguarding national and Hong Kong's security."
"We have to use some financial services and we don't know whether that will relate back to an agency that has some American business, and the use of credit cards will be sort of hampered and so on," Lam said in the interview with Chinese state broadcaster CGTN.
Story continues
Global banks in the city reviewed their client lists for potential people at risk ahead of the sanctions being opposed as tensions worsened between Beijing and Washington, but are trying to strike a balance between US regulators and the national security law, which prohibits the imposition of sanctions, blockades or other hostile actions against Hong Kong or the mainland, according to people familiar with their thinking.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city's de facto central bank, said on August 8 that unilateral sanctions by foreign governments are "not part of the international targeted financial sanctions regime and have no legal status in Hong Kong".
"The individual decisions - do we process a transaction, do we close an account - they would probably be made on an individual basis by individual banks or providers like Mastercard, etc to ensure both compliance with US and Hong Kong law," said Alexander Dmitrenko, head of Asia sanctions at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in Tokyo. The amount of Tang's mortgage was not disclosed in the Land Registry records, but he likely sacrificed a bigger mortgage by choosing Bank of China (Hong Kong), whose online valuation of the flat at HK$6.49 million is the lowest among the online valuations of five major banks checked by the Post.
HSBC, Hang Seng Bank, Standard Chartered and Citibank all valued the flat at HK$6.66 million and Tang could have obtained a bigger mortgage with the same loan-to-value ratio if he chose other banks.
Transferring a mortgage takes at least two months, so it is possible Tang began the shift as soon as June, according to mortgage agents.
The transfer of mortgage could "possibly" be motivated by a "political event", said Eric Tso, chief vice-president at mReferral Mortgage Brokerage Services, adding that the police chief may have conducted the transfer "gradually" alongside the credit union for the city's police force, Tso said.
The Hong Kong Police Credit Union began moving about HK$11 billion in assets from foreign banks to China-based lenders in May over concerns about potential sanctions.
"Before the sanctions, they might transfer the assets gradually and do some preparatory works with the banks themselves," Tso added. "Maybe Tang did not want any hassle and would transfer to a Chinese bank before [the sanction] to feel more assured. By spending some legal fees, he could do the transfer for some confidence."
Tang earned millions of Hong Kong dollars in profits over the last two decades by selling property, including a unit at Berkeley Bay Villa in Sai Kung and Monte Carlton in Tai Po, based on Land Registry transaction records.

Bolsas da Europa recuam com desempenho ruim dos bancos

Os índices europeus encerraram a terça-feira (18) em queda, pressionados pelo desempenho ruim das ações dos principais bancos do continente. Em um cenário mais amplo, o apetite global por risco é limitado nesta terça-feira, com as tensões crescentes entre Estados Unidos e China e pela indefinição sobre a aprovação de um novo pacote de estímulos fiscais em Washington.

O índice Stoxx 600 Europe recuou 0,56%, aos 367,18 pontos. Em Londres, o FTSE 100 caiu 0,83%, aos 6.076,62 pontos e, em Frankfurt, o DAX desvalorizou 0,30%, fechando o dia a 12.881,76 pontos. O índice CAC 40, referência da bolsa de Paris, cedeu 0,68%, aos 4.938,06 pontos. Em Milão e Madrid, as referências recuaram 0,52% e 0,66%, respectivamente.



Os investidores globais seguem cautelosos com a possibilidade de as relações entre Washington e Pequim piorarem ainda mais, após o Departamento de Comércio dos Estados Unidos ter emitido, na segunda (17), novas regras restringindo o acesso da Huawei Technologies a chips de fabricação estrangeira.



A medida ampliou as restrições do governo Trump aos acessos da Huawei a componentes cruciais para suas atividades. As novas regras proíbem empresas de fora dos EUA de vender qualquer chip feito com tecnologia americana para a Huawei sem uma licença especial.



Além disso, preocupações sobre um novo projeto de lei de estímulos fiscais no Congresso americano seguem pesando sobre o humor dos investidores globais, já que as negociações entre parlamentares democratas, republicanos e membros da Casa Branca chegaram ao que parece ser um impasse.



Outro motivo de receio para os investidores europeus é o avanço da pandemia no continente. A Alemanha registrou recentemente a maior contagem diária de novos casos de covid-19 em quatro meses: quase 1,7 mil infectados, a maior desde abril. A França registrou mais de 2,5 mil casos por dia nos últimos dias, um número que caiu drasticamente ontem para menos de 500. Da mesma forma, a Espanha registrou mais de 5 mil casos por dia várias vezes na semana passada, mas menos de 2 mil na segunda.



Os bancos tiveram o pior desempenho diário dentro do Stoxx 600, em queda de 1%. As empresas, sensíveis às perspectivas de retomada econômica, recuaram com as incertezas sobre o avanço da pandemia e das tensões sino-americanas. Os papéis do Natixis recuaram 2,35%, do Standard Chartered caíram 2,32% e do Virgin Money cederam 2,08%.



"O sentimento na Europa está fraco, mas o movimento positivo da libra esterlina fez com que o índice britânico de ações apresentasse um desempenho inferior. Em termos de pontos de índice, alguns dos maiores perdedores são a GlaxoSmithKline, a AstraZeneca, a British American Tobacco e a Unilever, empresas que têm uma grande parte de sua receita no exterior, de modo que a alta da libra é negativa para as ações”, afirmou o analista-sênior de mercados da CMC Markets, David Madden.

Singapore Leads Libor Exit With ‘Ground-Breaking’ Debt Sale

(Bloomberg) -- Singapore is blazing a trail in the global effort to replace Libor, becoming one of the first countries to auction debt linked to an alternative benchmark.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore sold S$500 million ($366 million) of six-month notes with a spread over the compounded Singapore Overnight Rate Average on Tuesday. The country is adopting SORA as it moves away from the SGD Swap offer rate, which uses the London interbank offered rate in computation.
The move is part of a broader push as policymakers around the world develop new benchmarks to replace Libor by the end of 2021, after trading informing the rate dried up and European and U.S. banks were found to have manipulated it for their own gain.
“It’s a ground-breaking initiative,” said Claude Brown, a partner at Reed Smith LLP in London. “It looks like MAS has already beaten the U.S. Treasury to it.”
‘Big Deal’
Hundreds of trillions of dollars of global assets are still tied to Libor, from student loans and mortgages to interest-rate swaps and collateralized loan obligations.
Analysts say banks, businesses and other national authorities could follow Singapore’s example after the transition lost steam during the coronavirus pandemic.
“It’s a big deal,” said John Coleman, senior managing director of the fixed-income group at R.J. O’Brien  Associates in Chicago. “The buy-side community has to adjust. When they see a government going this way, it’s no longer a gimmick or something that may go away.”
In the U.S., the Treasury is “very seriously studying the issue,” said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets. “I expect them to formally announce SOFR-linked debt later this year,” he said, referring to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, the Federal Reserve’s preferred replacement for dollar Libor.
Patchy Progress
Asia has lagged the rest of the world in preparing for the change, but Singapore could offer a regional template for the shift.
A few debt securities have already been issued off SORA, including ones from developer CapitaLand Ltd. and the country’s biggest lender DBS Group Holdings Ltd.
Eleven banks including Deutsche Bank AG, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank NA and DBS Group are ready to trade SORA derivatives, according to a June statement.
Progress on establishing alternative reference rates across the rest of Asia has been patchy. In Hong Kong, the Treasury Markets Association has identified the Hong Kong Dollar Overnight Index Average, or Honia, as an alternative rate to the Hong Kong interbank offered rate. The first Honia-linked interest rate swap was centrally cleared in July.
Honia still lacks traction in Hong Kong, partly because banks can continue to reference Hibor for existing and future loan products beyond 2021, according to Francis Chan, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Singapore’s move “may convince other governments and jurisdictions to look at their own practices,” said Jonathan Horan, partner at Linklaters LLP in Singapore. “Everyone needs to focus on this as the date for Libor discontinuance looms.”

La pandémie et la vague verte font flamber le cours de l’argent: MATIÈRES PREMIÈRES L’once de métal blanc s’échange à plus de 26 dollars, deux fois plus qu’il y a six mois. La valeur refuge attire les investisseurs. Elle est aussi prisée de l’industrie, des antennes 5G aux panneaux photovoltaïques

RICHARD ÉTIENNE @RiEtienne

Après l’or, l’argent. Le cours du métal blanc s’est envolé depuis le mois de mars, passant de moins de 12 dollars l’once à plus de 27 dollars ce lundi, après un pic à 29 dollars la semaine dernière. Ce prix est le plus élevé depuis six ans et cette hausse (de plus de moitié en six mois), la plus significative depuis 1979.

La demande est forte en ces temps de pandémie, notamment parce que ledit «or du pauvre» demeure une valeur refuge et que les taux d’intérêt sont négatifs, selon les analystes. Les avoirs dans des fonds négociés en bourse adossés à l’argent ont d’ailleurs atteint la bagatelle de 8445 tonnes cette année, presque le double du record précédent de 2009.

Faible résistance électrique

L’argent est également prisé des industriels, beaucoup plus que l’or. Les technologies durables, notamment les équipements électroniques et les panneaux solaires, sont en verve et elles représenteraient les trois quarts de la demande. Des mesures gouvernementales en faveur de l’environnement, à hauteur de 50 millions de dollars, ont été prises cette année à travers le globe, soulignent les experts du groupe BMO Capital Markets, alors que l’électricité des panneaux photovoltaïques est toujours plus compétitive. Joe Biden, le candidat démocrate aux Etats-Unis, place notamment les énergies vertes au centre de son plan de relance de l’économie américaine.

L’argent est aussi utilisé comme catalyseur dans la fabrication d’oxyde d’éthylène que l’on trouve dans les plastiques pour les masques faciaux et les gants, très demandés cette année. Les antennes 5G et les éoliennes, qui poussent un peu partout, en dépendent également, tout comme les véhicules électriques. L’argent possède la résistance électrique la plus faible parmi tous les métaux à des températures standards, et il n’existe pas de métaux de substitution, relève The Silver Institute, une organisation américaine.

«Le rythme d’achat a été incroyable pour les produits en argent, alors que vous attendez cela de l’or, selon Suki Cooper, une analyste de Standard Chartered citée par le Financial Times. Mais une fois que les investisseurs considèrent que le prix de l’or est trop élevé, ils tendent à se tourner vers l’argent, ou à regarder le ratio or/ argent et estimer qu’il est sous-évalué.» L’once du métal jaune s’est échangée à un record de 2060 dollars le 8 août, contre 1500 dollars en début d’année.

L’offre s’étiole

Les prix grimpent aussi parce que l’offre s’étiole. La pandémie a contraint les mines péruviennes et mexicaines, qui représentent près de 40% de l’approvisionnement mondial, à tourner au ralenti. Certaines pourraient même fermer temporairement, estime The Silver Institute. Les analystes de CRU Group, cités par Bloomberg, qui anticipaient en début d’année une hausse de la production d’argent de 4,5% en 2020, misent désormais sur une baisse de 4%. L’argent est souvent un produit dérivé dans des mines de cuivre, de zinc ou de plomb, des métaux qui s’échangent à bas prix, ce qui n’incite guère à une accélération des activités.

Construction of Hoima international airport boosts local business

Hoima, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | The local business community in Kabaale parish Kabaale sub county Hoima district is cashing in on the ongoing construction of Hoima international airport.

The construction works kicked off in April 2018 after government acquired a loan of US $309 million (about Shillings 1.1 trillion) from Standard Chartered Bank and UK Export Finance for the first phase of the project.

The construction works currently stand at 45% and the airport is expected to be completed by 2023.

The project is being executed by SBC Uganda Limited-a joint venture company between UK’s Colas limited and Shikun and Binui namely SBI International Holdings AG.

The project has changed the lives of residents of Nyamasoga, Buseruka, Kabaale, Nyakasenene and Kigaaga villages which neighbor the airport construction site.

Several general merchandise shops, restaurants, saloons, mini super markets and rental units among others have sprung up in the neighborhood to serve the workers at the airport.

Joseph India operates a retail shop in Kabaale village. According to India, business is booming because of the huge influx of people into the area compared to the past before the construction works started.

Justus Balyesiima, a resident of Nyamasoga village owns rental units. Balyesiima says he is already benefiting from the airport construction since his 15 rental units are all occupied.

Proscovia Kasemiira migrated from Hoima city to establish a restaurant in Nyamasoga near the airport construction site.

According to Kasemiira, she earns at least Shillings 200,000 on average each day from the workers at the airport who eat at her restaurant.

Jamil Kiyimba, a resident of Hoima city also migrated to the area and established a boutique. Kiyimba says he has been able to expand his shop something he wouldn’t have been able to achieve if he had remained in Hoima.

Ali Tinkamanyire, the Buseruka sub county LC 3 chairperson says residents have to benefit immensely since the construction of the airport started.

He calls on residents of Kabaale and Buseruka sub counties and the entire Bunyoro to prepare to benefit from the various government projects that are set to be established in the area.

Sitting on six square miles, upon completion, Hoima International airport will be the second international airport in Uganda after Entebbe. It is an important infrastructure for the oil sector in Uganda.

It will help facilitate the construction of the national oil refinery in Hoima and the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) that will connect to Tanga in Tanzania.

The airport is strategically located within the 29 square mile Kabaale industrial park that will host the national refinery and various industrial and commercial complexes.

It is being built in full compliance with the international standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as Category 4F, with capacity of handling large cargo planes such as the Boeing B747-800 and Antonov AN124.

A Dow buy signal says Warren Buffett's gold stake came too late for the precious metal

Gold had its best day since April on Monday, but market history says it may be time to bet against the precious metal. A surprising development helped to propel gold higher: long-time gold naysayer Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a big stake in gold miner Barrick Gold. While Buffett has dismissed gold as a shiny, useless "cube" in the past, Berkshire's bet could signal that even it sees value in gold as a market and inflation hedge. But don't read too much into the 2.5% one-day gain. Stocks — in particular the Dow Jones Industrial Average — may prove to be a better bet in the short-term, according to information from hedge fund trading tool Kensho. Granted, gold is having a great year, up over 31% and on pace for its best annual rally in a decade. But when gold spiked on Monday it was the highest level for the gold trade since August 11, and that's revealing in a potentially negative way. The precious metal took a sizable hit last week, declining by roughly 5%.  That ended a nine-week rally for gold, and since 2010, when thep precious metal suffers a one-week decline of 5% or more, it signals that it's time to buy the Dow, according to Kensho.

Over the past decade, gold has dropped by 5% or more 12 times and in a majority if the instances, gold remains negative over the next month while the Dow rises. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF,  the biggest gold fund, sheds about 1%, on average, trading negatively 59% of the time. Meanwhile, the Dow tends to get a boost, gaining 2.6%, on average, in the one-month trading window after gold has a big weekly loss, with the blue-chip stock index trading positively 67% of the time. Analysts noted that gold had been pressure by action in U.S. government bond yields, at the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a seven-week high last week.

But some market strategists expect speculative trading in gold to continue. "The sharp pullback in prices and the price action that has followed has revealed quite a bit about the underlying extent of speculative appetite for precious metals," Daniel Ghali, commodity strategist at TD Securities, told Reuters on Monday, adding that the fact Warren Buffett has now "embraced gold" is helping sentiment. Also helping gold on Monday was was weakness in the dollar and a reversal in the 10-year U.S. Treasury trade from last week. "We'll be above $2,000 per ounce before Fed minutes, and north of $2,250 by the end of year," Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, told Reuters. The minutes from the Fed's most recent FOMC meeting are due out Wednesday. Gold settled at just-under $2,000 on Monday. In early August, gold surged above $2,000 per ounce for the first time.  Some market experts believe the pandemic has added to interest in gold, as well as election uncertainty in the U.S., and a successful vaccine as well as resolution to presidential uncertainty could weigh on gold further out. While stocks and gold have risen in tandem during the recent market recovery, it was the Dow and not gold trailing the market on Monday. Wall Street also has been fending off concerns over stalled coronavirus stimulus negotiations and simmering U.S.-China tensions.

Gold bulls, meanwhile, don't seem to be running scared. Gold-backed exchange-traded funds have recorded eight consecutive months of positive flows, and added near- $10 billion in July, according to the World Gold Council. Standard Chartered Private Bank's Manpreet Gill said last week's pullback in gold prices was because of U.S. government yields, and the strategist told CNBC: "As long as yields stay below 1%, that doesn't really alter our longer-theme that ... central banks have really liked to do whatever they can to keep bond yields capped." The yield on the 10-year U.S. government bond is below 0.70%. "We think gold's run ... hasn't quite finished yet," said Gill, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities investment strategy at the bank. "It's quite easy to see gold going to $4,000," Frank Holmes, CEO at investment firm U.S. Global Investors, recently told CNBC about the years to come, pointing to the trillions of dollars needed in stimulus to help the U.S. economy during the pandemic, and the policy steps taken by central banks around the world. "We've not seen this level where central banks are printing money at a zero interest rate. At zero interest rates, gold becomes a very, very attractive asset class," Holmes told CNBC.

Stanbic Named Amongst Banks with Lowest Lending Rates

Stanbic Bank Uganda has been named among commercial banks that have maintained the lending rates below industry average in the first six months of the year according to the Bank of Uganda’s monetary report for August 2020.

Stanbic Bank, Absa bank, Baroda, Bank of India, Citibank, Ecobank, NC Bank Standard Chartered Bank, United Bank of Africa, and Exim Bank are listed as having charged borrowers lowest rates between January and June 2020, effectively making them the cheapest lenders for borrowers to run to.

According to BoU, the industry average lending rates in June 2020 was 17.2% having dropped from 20.06% in January same year. Stanbic bank’s prime lending rate stood at 16% as of august 1st having reduced it from 16.5% that it charged in May 2020. Citi Bank had the lowest charges at 15% although it does not offer loans to individual customers.

Accordingly, Banks with the lowest Bank rates had the best performing loans. In the annual performance review, StanbiC Banks Customer Loan grow by 14% from Shs 2.5 trillion in 2018 to Shs 2.9 trillion in 2019. The bank also grew its deposits by 21% from 3.9 trillion in 2018 to 4.7 trillion in 2019.

“As more customers trusted us with their money and our loans and advances grew by 14% by availing Ush 344 billion of new credit to key sectors of the economy such as manufacturing, agriculture and personal lending where we provided more than 40% of new lending. Our revenues grew 20% year-on-year to exceed Ushs 800 billion and were well diversified between lending and non-lending revenue. As a result, our profit after tax grew 20% to a record Ushs 259 billion over Ushs 215 billion posted in 2018, noted Patrick Mweheire, the former MD of Stanbic Bank while commenting about last year’s performance.

Mweheire further explained that the Bank was able to offer more value to its customers because of the technological innovations that it has put in place that has cut the bank’s operational costs while improving its effectiveness in service delivery.

“Due to our obsession with the client, we are consistently innovating to enhance their experience. In 2019, we delivered on several customer initiatives such as online account opening, mobile lending, enhanced agent banking; cash deposit machines which remain available 24/7. We also massively invested in technology by further enhancing our core banking system and several other peripheral systems such as internet banking and business on-line banking. As a result, over 85% of all the bank’s transactions are now executed digitally - branches are less than 15% from 40% less than 3 years ago. All of this digitization has allowed us to put banking back into the hands of the customer wherever and whenever they want. With an excess of 1,700 active agents across the country, agent banking has demystified the brick and mortar preposition and created a win-win for the banks and clients,” he noted.

Jio Phone Users Receive Jio Pay to Enable UPI-Based Payments: Report

Jio Phone users have started receiving Jio Pay with Unified Payments Interface (UPI) support, according to a report. The new experience, which is currently available to select users, was reportedly in internal testing for over a year, and its rollout to Jio Phone users reportedly took started on August 15. Some previous reports suggested that Jio had been working with National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to enable the proprietary payments experience on the Jio Phone — the 4G-supported smart feature phone that the operator launched in July 2017.

The initial rollout of Jio Pay for Jio Phone has brought the UPI-based payments experience to just over a thousand of users, reports BGR India. The website shared three images suggesting the presence of Jio Pay on a Jio Phone. The app seems to offer a list of features, namely Tap & Pay, Send Money, Recharge, and Accounts. It also could let users view their payment history.

For sending and receiving money, the Jio Pay app on Jio Phone seems to use UPI. It is also likely to leverage the built-in NFC of the phone to enable the Tap & Pay feature.

Jio reportedly reworked the UPI payment transaction system to bring Jio Pay to the Jio Phone, which runs on KaiOS. Also, the operator has Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd, Kotak Mahindra Bank, RBL Bank, Standard Chartered, State Bank of India, and Yes Bank on board to enable seamless payments.

Gadgets 360 has reached out to Jio for clarity on the Jio Pay rollout for Jio Phone users and will update this space when the company responds.

In January, the MyJio app of Jio was spotted enabling UPI-based payments for smartphone users. That move was aimed to counter the likes of Google Pay and WhatsApp, both of which have already offered a similar experience for the masses in the past.

In 2020, will WhatsApp get the killer feature that every Indian is waiting for? We discussed this on Orbital, our weekly technology podcast, which you can subscribe to via Apple Podcasts or RSS, download the episode, or just hit the play button below.

The report has also revealed a set of images of the UPI-enabled service from the telco as seen above. These screenshots have been shared by a JioPhone user in Mumbai. The application uses UPI and the report hints that UPI supports complete features such as Add Bank, Pay through VPA, Scan and Pay, and Transaction History.

As per the report, the Jio Pay service has been built on a tokenization platform. It uses the Tap and Pay contactless payment via NFC in any POS machine supporting NFC. For now, Jio has bands such as Axis Bank, ICICI Bank HDFC Bank, SBI, IndusInd, Standard Chartered, Yes Bank, Kotak Bank, and RBL Bank onboard. It is claimed that both debit and credit cards of these banks of the above-mentioned banks can be tokenized and utilized for payment.

Jio has re-worked with NPCI for Kai OS on JioPhone as the NPCI library is responsible to bring the payments screen whenever users key in their UPI PIN for all the transactions.

Furthermore, the report notes that the Jio Pay UPI service will witness a wider rollout soon. An official announcement could be made in the coming days. Only the original JioPhone users have received the UPI feature and the JioPhone 2 users need to wait for the same to be rolled out to them. And, the same could be announced at the official launch of the service.

Open Banking is gaining momentum in Bahrain, Mena

Open Banking
The Open Banking revolution in Mena, kickstarted by the Central Bank of Bahrain, is gaining momentum in the kingdom and the region


The advent of open banking, mandated in 2019, positions Bahrain at the heart of the Open Banking revolution and emphasising its pioneering role in the FinTech sector.


The banking sector will, in turn, develop data-driven and frictionless, customer-centric experiences that will empower consumers across Mena.


Various Open Banking awareness campaigns have been rolled out in the region, including educational campaigns, a virtual resource hub, and new job opportunities within the FinTech sector.


Over the past 7 months, the kingdom has witnessed several banks investing in Open Banking products that are powered by Tarabut Gateway; Mena’s first licensed Open Banking platform.


Dalal Buhejji, Director of Business Development, Financial Services at Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) said: “We are witnessing rapid shifts within Mena’s Open Banking scene. Bahrain is a global leader and is consistently improving the frameworks to facilitate and support the transformations taking place. This will drive greater competition and more rapid adoption in other global markets as well. Our innovative focused regulations and thriving FinTech ecosystem have made it possible to set new standards for digital banks in the region in less than a year.


“Banks are starting to see Open Banking as an opportunity here, and this mindset will attract new developments and innovations in the banking industry. These successful milestones will make the transition to better banking and financial experiences more seamless and efficient. The financial industry can only transform by integrating forward-thinking regulations and strategic alliances with all the major players in the sector.”


Financial institutions throughout the region will soon be able to offer account aggregation services, and a range of new Open Banking services within this year. These strategic partnerships with Tarabut Gateway have set in motion a move to a new way of banking and will support banks in Bahrain to create a more seamless and intuitive banking experiences.


Recently, the Fintech Startup Ecosystem in Bahrain was ranked among the fastest-growing sectors in the Middle East. Open Banking will drive simplicity and increase flexibility within the financial landscape, allowing financial institutions to leverage the rich data they have to offer customers innovative and targeted products that best suit their needs.


This, in turn, will empower bank customers across the kingdom to take control of their finances, make better decisions, and manage multiple accounts through a single application.


Open Banking will accelerate collaboration between financial institutions and FinTechs in Mena and will fundamentally transform the current banking experience into a more intuitive and personalised experience. With detailed insights and more data points becoming accessible, banks will now be able to offer better financial products and services for their consumers.


These personalised insights will increase engagement, sales, and overall revenue for the bank when utilised efficiently. Hence paving the way to a new world of financial services.


Waheed Al Qassim, CEO, Bahrain Association of Banks, said: “Collaborations and partnerships is the first step and the key driver behind a new world of financial services. By partnering with FinTechs, banks will be able to build a marketplace of third-party tools and solutions, which will strengthen their position by providing the next generation of financial services. This personalised and collaborative touch to the digital banking experience will grow revenues for both parties. With rich data, Banks will be able to build new innovative products and monetise through addressing untapped opportunities.


Kunal Varma, Head of Retail Banking (Middle East), Standard Chartered Bank, said: “Bahrain is playing a leading role in delivering on its open banking promise across the region. These collaborations will allow banks in the region to harness innovative technologies while leveraging the rapidly evolving ecosystem of data sources to deliver digital-only experiences. The Fintech sector in Bahrain is rapidly growing, and especially at this time, there is a need to deliver innovative propositions. This shift will encourage other banks to offer solutions that enable greater transparency and inclusivity.”


Abdulla Almoayed, CEO of Tarabut Gateway, commented on the progress in the region: “Open Banking is one of the most exciting developments in the financial services sector and has been an interesting journey for us for far. We are pleased to see banks regionally recognising the importance of adopting this technology and realising the impact it brings for its customers. This shift will develop Open Banking case studies for the Mena region, which will encourage others to join. We want to be part of that journey and play our role in Mena as the trusted Open Banking partner for financial institutions and FinTechs in the region.” -- Tradearabia News Service

Hong Kong’s police chief shifted mortgage ahead of US sanctions

The law did not specify what constitutes a significant transaction and bankers and other financial professionals in the city are hoping the issue will soon be clarified, according to compliance lawyers.

“Financial institutions in Hong Kong are watching very closely for further guidance from the US Treasury Department on the definition of a significant transaction for the purposes of Hong Kong sanctions,” said Nicholas Turner, a lawyer with Steptoe & Johnson in Hong Kong who specialises in economic sanctions.

spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the bank does not discuss individual clients. (Hong Kong), one of the city’s three currency-issuing banks along with HSBC and Standard Chartered, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Chinese-language newspaper HK01 first reported on its website Tuesday that Tang moved his mortgage. Aspokeswoman declined to comment, saying the bank does not discuss individual clients.(Hong Kong), one of the city’s three currency-issuing banks along with HSBC and Standard Chartered, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

“The commissioner reiterated that it is his responsibility and honour to maintain national security and the security of Hong Kong, and that foreign sanctions are meaningless to him,” Hong Kong’s police said in its statement. “He will continue to concentrate on the work of safeguarding national and Hong Kong's security.”

“We have to use some financial services and we don’t know whether that will relate back to an agency that has some American business, and the use of credit cards will be sort of hampered and so on,” Lam said in the interview with Chinese state broadcaster CGTN.

Global banks in the cityfor potential people at risk ahead of the sanctions being opposed as tensions worsened between Beijing and Washington, but are trying to strike a balance between US regulators and the national security law, which prohibits the imposition of sanctions, blockades or other hostile actions against Hong Kong or the mainland, according to people familiar with their thinking.

“The individual decisions – do we process a transaction, do we close an account – they would probably be made on an individual basis by individual banks or providers like Mastercard, etc to ensure both compliance with US and Hong Kong law,” said Alexander Dmitrenko, head of Asia sanctions at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in Tokyo. The amount of Tang’s mortgage was not disclosed in the Land Registry records, but he likely sacrificed a bigger mortgage by choosing Bank of China (Hong Kong), whose online valuation of the flat at HK$6.49 million is the lowest among the online valuations of five major banks checked by the Post.

HSBC, Hang Seng Bank, Standard Chartered and Citibank all valued the flat at HK$6.66 million and Tang could have obtained a bigger mortgage with the same loan-to-value ratio if he chose other banks.

Transferring a mortgage takes at least two months, so it is possible Tang began the shift as soon as June, according to mortgage agents.

The transfer of mortgage could “possibly” be motivated by a “political event”, said Eric Tso, chief vice-president at mReferral Mortgage Brokerage Services, adding that the police chief may have conducted the transfer “gradually” alongside the credit union for the city’s police force, Tso said.

“Before the sanctions, they would transfer the assets gradually and do some preparatory works with the banks themselves,” Tso added. “Maybe Tang did not want any hassle and would transfer to a Chinese bank before [the sanction] to feel more assured. By spending some legal fees, he could buy some assurance.”

US sanctions will make everyday life a headache for Hong Kong's political leaders and their families, from closed accounts to blocked payments

Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Yuet-ngor and other officials sanctioned by the US government over a national security law are clinging to the premise that the measures will be harmless because they do not have American bank accounts or own property in the United States.
But, the long reach of the American government - and the dominance of the US dollar as a trade currency - could throw up an array of unexpected barriers for so-called specially designated nationals (SDNs), according to former American officials and compliance lawyers.
Sanctioned individuals - and in some cases their close family members - could find overseas bank accounts closed, bank-issued credit cards cancelled and insurance coverage put on hold by financial institutions wary of running afoul of US regulators and losing access to the American financial system, compliance officials said.
Transactions with US companies, including ordering from American websites such as Amazon.com, are likely to be blocked and even booking a staycation at a US-owned hotel chain could prove difficult, if not impossible, depending on how the company's foreign subsidiaries are structured, said Julia Friedlander, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.
"What that does is pushes an individual out of the US dollar system," Friedlander, a former senior policy adviser in the US Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said. "If they want to conduct payments, they're going to have to do so using financial institutions that are cut off from the US financial system and largely will not transact in dollars."
On August 8, the US Treasury Department sanctioned 11 Hong Kong and mainland officials, including Lam, the current and former police commissioners and the head of Beijing's local liaison office, over the implementation of the national security law, which American officials claim undermines the city's autonomy and could curb freedom in the city. They also barred those officials and close family members from travelling to the US.
Story continues
The Hong Kong sanctions followed a July 14 executive order by US President Donald Trump and the passage of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which would allow the US to sanction foreign banks and other financial institutions who engage in "significant" transactions with individuals deemed to have contributed to the erosion of the city's autonomy.
"Sanctions like these, while they of course carry a very heavy dose of symbolism, they also have some pretty practical impacts from a financial standpoint," said Scott Flicker, the chairman of Paul Hastings' Washington office and leader of the law firm's global trade controls practice. "You don't need to be present in the United States and you don't need to be dealing specifically with a US financial institution to be affected."
Violating sanctions can be costly for financial institutions and other companies that breach US sanctions, even if inadvertently.
For example, American Express agreed to pay US$204,000 to the US three years ago after a Belgian credit-card issuer processed more than 1,800 transactions in violation of sanctions against Cuba. Amex owned a 50 per cent stake in the Belgian firm's parent company.
The Hong Kong sanctions are being administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an arm of the Treasury Department. Over seven decades, the office has overseen sanctions against Cuba, Iran and North Korea and Russia.
OFAC regulations prohibit US persons and entities from providing goods or services with sanctioned individuals, entities or countries and property or assets held by those facing US sanctions are subject to freezing and potential seizure.
Depending on the sanctions programme, special licenses are required for a US citizen to meet with a SDN or for a sanctioned foreign leader to stay at a US-owned hotel overseas.
While there is a process to appeal a sanction designation, being removed from a sanctions list is difficult, lawyers said. The designations stem from the president's executive power under the US Constitution, they said.
For the most part, Hong Kong and mainland officials have mocked the measures.
Lam said in a television interview last month that she had no assets in the United States and "I don't particularly like going to the US", while Luo Huining, director of Beijing's liaison office in the city, sarcastically offered on August 8 to send US$100 to US President Donald Trump, so that it could be frozen.
To be sure, sanctioned individuals are less likely to struggle if they do not hold assets in the US and make most of their transactions in currencies other than the US dollar, such as the yuan.
The challenge, however, comes if their financial institution needs to access the US financial system regularly.
Following a series of multibillion-dollar settlements with American authorities over anti-money-laundering and sanctions breaches, banks and other financial institutions are much more cautious when it comes to doing business with so-called politically exposed persons. That includes individuals the US has not sanctioned.
As a result, financial institutions are severing ties with foreign individuals who are more likely to come under American scrutiny, as well as US clients in some cases, to avoid falling under the purview of US authorities.

"Many banks take a highly risk averse approach to these issues," said Adam Ferguson, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland in Hong Kong.
Bernard Chan, convenor of the Executive Council, said he had one of his US bank accounts closed in March unrelated to sanctions, after the lender learned of his political role in the city. Chan is one of only two members of Lam's de facto cabinet who have declared American assets.
"After the news of my account being closed in the US, I've been approached by other banks in Hong Kong, including a US bank, to open an account with them in Hong Kong," Chan said. "But I've enough bank accounts already and l don't need any more."
Chan, who is not facing sanctions, did not name the bank that closed his account. He has another account in the US that remains open.
Even ahead of the US sanctions, global banks in Hong Kong were quietly reviewing their client lists for people at risk, according to people familiar with their thinking.
Two of the city's three currency-issuing banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, have paid a combined US$4 billion since 2012 and reached agreements with US authorities to avoid criminal prosecution for past failures in their anti-money-laundering and sanctions control programmes.
In recent days, Citigroup took steps to suspend credit-card accounts associated with some of the individuals facing US sanctions, according to a person familiar with the moves but not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.
Bloomberg reported on August 12 that the Hong Kong arms of some Chinese state-owned banks, including Bank of China (Hong Kong), are being cautious about opening new accounts for individuals facing sanctions.
Spokespersons at Citigroup, HSBC and Standard Chartered all declined to comment for this story, while Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment.
The credit union for the city's police force began moving about HK$11 billion in assets from foreign banks to China-based lenders in May over concerns about potential sanctions.
Rising tensions between the US and China threatens to trap financial institutions between the two superpowers.
Trump's executive order prohibits "the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked" by the sanctions. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act separately includes a provision that subjects banks who engage in "significant" transactions with blocked persons to sanctions themselves.
At the same time, Article 29 of the city's national security law prohibits the imposition of sanctions, blockades or other hostile actions against Hong Kong or the mainland - potentially putting banks in a bind if they abide by the US decrees.
Bankers are reluctant to discuss publicly how they will address any potential clash, saying privately they would look to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's de facto central bank, for guidance on how to proceed regarding their Hong Kong business.
"With respect to the various laws that exist and the potential conflicts between those laws, we follow the laws and regulations of all of the countries in which we operate and will continue to do that," Noel Quinn, HSBC's chief executive, said on a conference call with journalists on August 3. "It would be wrong of me to speculate on any potential conflicts between different laws between the US and China."
The HKMA said on August 8 that unilateral sanctions by foreign governments are "not part of the international targeted financial sanctions regime and have no legal status in Hong Kong", sparking confusion among some bankers.

At the same time, businesses and other entities with ties to sanctioned individuals could face their own challenges under US sanctions. Related companies in which a sanctioned individual owns 50 per cent or more can be blocked from engaging in transactions in the American financial system.
The US placed Arkady Rotenberg, a Russian businessman and a former judo partner of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and his brother Boris Rotenberg under sanctions in 2014, but Arkady Rotenberg transferred part of his business to his son Igor in an attempt to avoid sanctions. The US placed Igor Rotenberg under sanctions four years later.
One Hong Kong company already took steps last week to reduce its potential exposure because of family ties.
Engineering firm Analogue Holdings issued a statement on August 9 that Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, the city's Secretary for Justice and wife of Analogue's chairman, did not have an interest in the company and no rights to the shares held by her husband. She is one of the 11 officials sanctioned by the US government.
The next day, Analogue announced it had reduced its interest in New York-based Transel Elevator  Electric because of US-China tensions and no longer held a controlling stake in the American company.
Sanctioned individuals acting as signatories on contracts, such as a contract with the Hong Kong government, also can prove problematic for companies and lead to penalties.
For example, OFAC fined Exxon US$2 million in 2017, claiming agreements the energy giant signed with Russian oil company Roseft violated US sanctions because the signer of the contracts, Rosneft's president, was facing sanctions himself. A federal court vacated the penalty in December after a lengthy court fight.
Enhanced enforcement by the US in recent years is increasingly causing banks to shy away from business, even if it is technically legal, over concerns about the potential for enhanced compliance risk later, Flicker, the Paul Hastings lawyer, said.
"If you are a person on the OFAC SDN list, it is a near certainty that you're going to face difficulty in opening bank accounts or conducting bank transactions with global financial institutions that may be in that de-risking mode," Flicker said.

Gold's explosive rally is not 'quite finished yet,' a Standard Chartered strategist said | Markets Insider

Gold faced its worst daily drop in seven years last week, but one Standard Chartered strategist thinks the precious metal's rally is far from over. 

Gold broke $2,000 per ounce for the first time in history at the start of the month, and is up 31% in 2020.

Standard Chartered 's Manpreet Gill told CNBC's Street Signs Asia: "We think gold's run ... hasn't quite finished yet."

He said it is "ultimately a great environment for gold" assuming bond yields remain low.

Gold has faced a rollercoaster journey in recent weeks. It first broke to record highs at the beginning of August, before slumping last week, facing its worst daily drop in seven years, bringing into question whether the rally was inflated and if a huge meltdown may be underway. 

Gold remains up 31% year to date, and is still above $2,000 per ounce, but is down about 3% from its high of $2,063 at the beginning of the month.

But for Gill, the rally is far from over. He attributed last week's slowdown in gold prices to higher bond yields. 





US Treasury yields rose last week after positive progress was made on coronavirus vaccines. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury Bill rose to a weekly high of 0.71%. 

Gold does not yield a return, so when yields are higher it makes it less attractive to hold gold. When yields are lower, it means investors have to give up less potential yield in order to hold the precious metal.

Bangladesh Blockchain Makes Its First Transaction

Garment exporter Viyellatex has successfully conducted a transaction using blockchain technology with the help of Standard Chartered

Standard Chartered has successfully carried out Bangladesh’s first blockchain transaction using a letter of credits on the Contour blockchain. The bank acted as the advisory and also the issuing bank for the letter of credit for textile export company, Viyellatex.

Blockchain payments are paperless, save time and are very efficient.

Traditional transactions can result in long waiting times, with servicing and processing fees charged by intermediaries. Often, by the time the money is received, it is not guaranteed that the recipient will get the full amount due to varying exchange rates.

When the same transactions are automated via blockchain, there are no fees charged by intermediaries, and the time to process the transaction is much lower.

By eliminating unnecessary fees, Viyellatex is expecting higher efficiencies and cost reductions.

The CEO and Chairman of Viyellatex, KM Rezaul Hasanat, commented:

“Blockchain technology will certainly increase trading efficiency and reduce the turnaround time of the LC process.”

The use of the Contour blockchain in the transaction was likely intentional, as Standard Chartered was one of its founding members. Many Asian banks are working with blockchain-based platforms for trade.

The bank was responsible for piloting the first cross-border blockchain letter of credit in the oil industry, and was also the first to peg the system with the Chinese Yuan.

Many businesses and countries are starting to recognise how much blockchain can help facilitate transactions — as the technology is a great fit for any cross-border transaction.

This poses a threat to financial institutions that do not adopt the technology, as their business model relies on acting as an intermediary for global clearing operations.

Many banks have started to adopt blockchain payment solutions. Banco Santander recently introduced a payment app, One Pay FX, in collaborations with Ripple.

The Chief Technology Officer of One Pay FX, Ed Metzger, shared that:

“They have so much confidence in the low cost, same day process, it’s no longer a big deal to send money abroad”.

The app allows people to transparently send money through blockchain to result in more transparency and less costs than traditional methods. The existing system for sending money internationally can take three to five days, with much higher costs attached to using it.

Commodities Report: Buffett Bets on Gold: Here's Why -- WSJ | MarketScreener

Gold has piqued the interest of Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has bought shares in Canadian mining company Barrick Gold Corp. The move brings the spotlight back on the precious metal, which notched new records this month, soaring above $2,000 a troy ounce for the first time in New York trading.

The price of gold has jumped 30% in 2020 -- outstripping the rally in the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index -- in a bull run that began in late 2018 and has gathered momentum during the coronavirus pandemic.

Here is how the gold market works, and why prices are on the rise now.

What is the gold market?

There are two gold markets, closely linked because investment banks and other big players are active in both.

The first is the physical market, which brings together miners, refiners, jewelers, central banks, electronics manufacturers, banks and investors. London is the focal point, dating back to the first gold rush from Brazil in 1697, according to the London Bullion Market Association, which oversees the market. Shanghai, Zurich, Dubai and Hong Kong are also hubs.

The second market is the futures market, for swapping financial contracts based on gold. This market is electronic, hosted by New York's Comex exchange, and sets the prices you read about in The Wall Street Journal. It gives investors an opportunity to speculate on gold prices rising or falling without holding the metal, and miners a way to insulate themselves from unexpected price drops.

How does the physical market work?

Deals to buy, sell and lend gold in London are struck privately, rather than on an exchange. To reduce the amount of metal that has to be shunted from vault to vault, five banks act as a clearing house, balancing out each other's sales and purchases. Some of them provide vaults, offering clients a safe place to stash gold. The Bank of England guards more than 400,000 bars beneath the narrow streets of the City of London, largely on behalf of the U.K. government and other central banks, a hoard second only to that of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York

Prices are quoted by troy ounce (14.6 troy ounces to the pound, instead of the standard 16) of pure gold, and bullion trades in batches of 400-ounce bars. London prices are fixed in twice-daily auctions and act as a benchmark throughout the physical market. When a watchmaker buys gold from a refiner, it usually does so at a premium to the London price.

To avoid paying for tons of gold, tying up millions of dollars in cash, industrial users often borrow metal instead of buying it outright. Banks either lease it to them, charging interest, or lend with more complex forward, swap and repurchase deals.

How does the financial market work?

Futures are standardized contracts that lock in prices for gold that will change hands at a specified date. Buyers and sellers agree to swap 100 troy ounces (a new Comex contract that allows delivery of 400 ounces has barely traded). Gold futures trading data go back to the final day of 1974, when Comex launched the market to coincide with a law allowing Americans to own bullion for the first time in four decades.

Most traders exit futures trades before they actually exchange gold. Recently, however, more investors have taken delivery of gold on the Comex, a sign demand for physical gold is unusually high.

How do the physical and futures markets interact?

In good times, gold costs roughly the same amount in London's physical market and on New York's Comex. If prices move out of whack, banks bring them back in line by buying bullion on the cheap in one city, flying it across the Atlantic (normally in the cargo hold of a passenger plane) and selling at a profit where prices are higher. They must factor in the small sum it costs to recast the gold, since Comex requires smaller bars, weighing either 100 troy ounces or a kilo.

The pandemic scrambled this self-correcting mechanism in March. A dearth of flights led to fears of a shortage in New York, sending futures well above spot prices in London. The concerns proved unfounded, but the violent price moves led to losses at banks including HSBC Holdings PLC. That has prompted banks to trade less actively on the Comex, which could make futures more volatile, said David Govett, head of precious metals at brokerage Marex Spectron.

How do investors buy and sell gold?

Professional fund managers bet on gold prices with futures. To avoid taking hold of a large amount of bullion, investors typically sell futures before they expire and buy later-dated contracts, in a process known as rolling. This comes at a cost because longer-dated futures cost more than spot gold. The difference is pocketed by the investor's counterparty -- normally an investment banker -- who gets to buy low and sell high.

Mom-and-pop investors buy physical bars and coins, which they can either stow at home or in a vault. One-ounce gold eagles, produced by the U.S. Mint and sold by dealers like Kitco Metals Inc., are among the most popular.

Demand for bars and coins has shot up during the pandemic, said Robert Higgins, chief executive of Argent Asset Group, though clients are also selling to profit on rising prices.

"When things go crazy and the surety of everything is questioned, the two things everyone turns to are gold and silver," he said. This wasn't always the case: In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered Americans to hand over all gold coins, bars and certificates to banks, seeking to staunch a rush to exchange paper money for bullion during the Great Depression.

Investors who want exposure to gold prices without the hassle of storing bullion or trading futures found an alternate solution in 2003: exchange-traded funds. These funds, which have surged in popularity, buy gold and issue shares that trade on the stock exchange. ETFs bought a record 734 metric tons of gold in the first half of 2020, according to the World Gold Council, taking overall holdings to 3,621 tons.

This buying offset a 46% slump in sales of jewelry, a common means of investing in gold in Asia. India and China led the decline, which the WGC attributed to shop closures, economic uncertainty and high prices.

The main reason is this year's precipitous drop in yields on U.S. Treasurys to levels below the expected pace of inflation. Unlike bonds or bank deposits, gold doesn't pay any income. As a result, owning gold means missing out on yields from other assets when interest rates are high. When real yields are negative, gold's lack of yield becomes a strength.

The Federal Reserve's March decision to slash interest rates to just above zero and buy hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds has pulled down yields in fixed-income markets, prompting investors to buy gold instead. Some money managers expect inflation to pick up once the economic crunch is over, which would act as a further drag on real yields if nominal rates don't rise.

Investors are also buying gold because they think it will hold its value if stocks take another tumble. Enthusiasts take this argument a step further, contending that gold is the ultimate insurance policy against a scenario in which the U.S. government defaults or kindles inflation to alleviate the burden of debt.

"Gold is a haven," said Rhona O'Connell, head of market analysis for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia at StoneX Group. "It doesn't have anyone else's political or financial risk associated with it."

Another tailwind for gold right now is the depreciation in the dollar. Buyers outside the U.S. are willing to pay a higher dollar price when the greenback weakens, making gold cheaper in terms of their home currencies. This relationship doesn't always hold: Gold and the dollar shot up in tandem in March during a period of turmoil in financial markets.

How does this compare with previous bull runs?

Two other run-ups have taken place since President Nixon cut the link between gold and dollars in August 1971. The most dramatic spanned the rest of the 1970s, when inflation exacerbated by twin oil crises led the gold price in London to soar from $43 a troy ounce to a peak of $850 in early 1980.

"We're in World War Eight, if you believe the market," a commodities broker named James Sinclair told the New York Times on Jan. 21 of that year, the day prices crested.

Prices jumped again from 2008-2011, when interest rates fell because of aggressive stimulus measures by the Fed and a recession that was, at that point, the worst since the Great Depression. Worries that bond-buying by the Fed would lead to runaway inflation -- which didn't transpire -- also contributed to the advance

It took three years after the start of the previous financial crisis for gold prices to peak, notes Edmund Moy, who was director of the U.S. Mint at the time.

"They kept on going up until it was very clear that the U.S. economy would recover slowly and that there would not be inflation," he said. "I think we're at the very beginning of momentum for gold prices going up."

Gold prices tend to overshoot, according to Fergal O'Connor, an economist at University College Cork who has studied the market's history. Still, he expects them to fall back to a higher level than they were before the pandemic because institutional investors are adding to their gold holdings, removing a chunk of available supply. The return of jewelry demand in China and India could also boost prices.

The biggest deciding factor will be the direction of interest rates, adjusted for inflation, said Suki Cooper, an analyst at Standard Chartered. "It's real yields that are really driving the flows into gold."

Where does gold come from?

Ist China in Gefahr, aus dem globalen Finanzsystem ausgeschlossen zu werden?

Experten innerhalb Chinas schlagen zunehmend Alarm wegen möglicher US-Sanktionen gegen chinesische Finanzinstitute, die sie vom globalen Finanzsystem abschneiden könnten.

Präsident Donald Trump hat in den letzten Monaten eine härtere Gangart gegen die Kommunistische Partei Chinas (KPC) eingeschlagen. Als Reaktion auf die Untergrabung der Autonomie Hongkongs durch das Regime hat Trump die besonderen wirtschaftlichen Privilegien der Stadt gegenüber den Vereinigten Staaten beendet. Er wandelte das Hongkonger Autonomiegesetz in ein Gesetz um, das Einzelpersonen und Körperschaften sanktioniert, die an der jüngsten Zerschlagung der Demokratie in Hongkong beteiligt waren.


Zudem wurden das Stadtoberhaupt Carrie Lam und zehn weitere chinesische und Hongkonger Beamte sanktioniert, die an der Untergrabung der Freiheiten des Territoriums beteiligt waren.

Trotz eskalierender Spannungen zwischen den beiden größten Volkswirtschaften der Welt erscheint eine vollständige finanzielle „Entkoppelung“ – welche die chinesischen Finanzinstitutionen effektiv aus dem globalen Dollar-Regelungssystem ausschließen würde – unwahrscheinlich. Aber auch Sanktionen gegen die chinesischen Social-Media-Apps TikTok und WeChat schienen noch vor wenigen Monaten unwahrscheinlich.

Die Gefahr einer finanziellen Entkoppelung ist real, und ihre schwerwiegenden Folgen veranlassen die KPC und den chinesischen Finanzsektor, ihre Optionen zu prüfen.


Ausgesperrt

Ein vollständiger Finanzkrieg könnte die chinesischen Banken aus dem Dollarsystem, auf dem der größte Teil des Welthandels basiert, ausschließen. Die Trump-Administration könnte chinesische Banken und Finanzinstitute sanktionieren und sogar chinesische Vermögenswerte in den Vereinigten Staaten beschlagnahmen.


Was bedeutet das und warum ist das von Bedeutung? Das Lebenselixier einer Bank sind die Geldtransaktionen. Die meisten internationalen grenzüberschreitenden Transaktionen werden in US-Dollar abgewickelt.

Internationale Banküberweisungen, die in US-Dollar abgewickelt werden, verwenden meist das SWIFT-System, eine Nachrichtensprache, die seit den 1970er Jahren von globalen Banken verwendet wird, um Zahlungen anzuweisen. Rund 11.000 Banken in der ganzen Welt verwenden SWIFT, um laut der SWIFT-Website 38 Millionen Transaktionen pro Tag durchzuführen.

Sollten chinesische Finanzinstitute von den Vereinigten Staaten sanktioniert werden, könnte SWIFT solche Unternehmen von der Nutzung des Nachrichtensystems für Transaktionen ausschließen, was die KPC von der Abwicklung von US-Dollar-Transaktionen überall auf der Welt ausschließen könnte.


Obwohl SWIFT seinen Sitz in Belgien hat und den Gesetzen der Europäischen Union unterliegt, hat es Vorrang beim Ausschluss von Institutionen, die den US-Sanktionsgesetzen unterliegen (z.B. Nordkorea). Und auch die wichtigsten Transaktionsmethoden innerhalb der USA – Fedwire und CHIPS – wären für chinesische Institutionen nicht verfügbar.

In einem vollständigen Finanzkrieg könnten die Vereinigten Staaten auch Vermögenswerte von sanktionierten Einrichtungen und Einzelpersonen einfrieren und ihnen den Zugang zu im Inland ansässigen Vermögenswerten verwehren. Vermögenswerte im Wert von Hunderten Milliarden Dollar in chinesischem Besitz wie Bankkonten, Investitionen und Immobilien, würden effektiv eingefroren. Nach Angaben des American Enterprise Institute überstiegen die chinesischen Investitionen in den Vereinigten Staaten von 2005 bis Ende 2019 180 Milliarden Dollar.

RMB-Annahme rückläufig

„Chinesische Finanzinstitutionen und Aufsichtsbehörden sollten das potenzielle Risiko, von SWIFT abgeschnitten zu werden, vollständig einschätzen“, schrieb Shi Jiayou, Professor an der Renmin-Universität von China, in einer Stellungnahme in Caixin, einem Wirtschaftsmagazin des chinesischen Festlands. „Anstatt blind auf das Beste zu hoffen, sollte China vorausschauend planen.

Eine der Eventualitäten, die Peking seit Anfang der 2000er Jahre plant, ist die Internationalisierung seiner Währung, des Yuan. Trotz anhaltender Bemühungen wie der Einführung von auf Yuan lautenden Überseeanleihen, der Einrichtung von Yuan-Wechselkursanbindungen und der Initiative „One Belt, One Road Infrastructure Investment“ wurden in den letzten Jahren nur sehr wenige Fortschritte bei der internationalen Verwendung des Yuan erzielt.

Die internationale Verwendung des Yuan ist in den letzten fünf Jahren sogar zurückgegangen. Der Renminbi (RMB)-Globalisierungsindex der Standard Chartered Bank, der die Internationalisierung des Yuan seit 2011 misst, erreichte im November 2015 mit einem Wert von 2.563 seinen Höchststand. Der jüngste Wert vom März 2020 lag bei 2.224, mäßig niedriger als 2015. Standard Chartered, eine führende Bank im asiatisch-pazifischen Raum, verfügt vermutlich über die umfassendsten Daten zum Offshore-Yuan.

Handel China-Russland nur zu 46 Prozent in Dollar

In jüngster Zeit ist Peking eine Partnerschaft mit Moskau eingegangen, um die Abhängigkeit von der globalen Hegemonie des US-Dollars zu verringern. Die Verwendung des US-Dollars im bilateralen Handel zwischen Russland und China fiel im ersten Quartal 2020 zum ersten Mal unter 50 Prozent.



Offiziell wurden 46 Prozent der russisch-chinesischen Transaktionen in Dollar und 30 Prozent in Euro abgewickelt, während die Abwicklung des Handels mit Rubel und Yuan zusammen nur 24 Prozent der Transaktionen ausmachte, so die von der Nikkei Asian Review zitierten Daten der russischen Regierung.

Während die Dollar-Verwendungskennzahl angesichts der langjährigen Absicht Chinas und Russlands, den Dollar zu „ent-dollarisieren“, immer noch hoch zu sein scheint, begrüßten Moskau und Peking dies laut dem Nikkei-Bericht in den Worten von Alexey Maslow von der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften immer noch als „Durchbruch“.

Malaysians confident in skills to thrive despite Covid-19

KUCHING: Covid-19 is significantly impacting personal finances globally, with one-third (29 per cent) in Malaysia already earning less and more than half expecting the pandemic to further affect their income and/or employment.

Yet, most Malaysians are confident in their skills and prepared to adapt and work harder to realise opportunities in a post-Covid-19 world.

This was based on findings in a Standard Chartered survey of 12,000 adults across twelve markets including Malaysia, offerin insights into their financial wellbeing and employment outlook in these challenging times, and how banks can play a role in helping them manage their money.

It reveals a stark contrast between the financial reality that people face and their confidence in the future.

This can be explained by a willingness – particularly among young people and those in emerging markets – to work harder, take steps to adapt income streams and reskill if they can, in order to earn more.

According to Standard Chartered Malaysia managing director and chief executive officer Abrar A Anwar, “Malaysians in general have been hit hard by the economic impact of the pandemic, with one-third of them already earning less.

“Although they’re expecting their income and employment to be further affected, their confidence in their skills provides hope for the recovery.

“A majority of younger Malaysians have also expressed that they’re keen to start a new business or set up a second income stream in the wake of the pandemic but want to learn how to manage their finances better.

“They must be supported. Banks have a role to play both by helping them manage their money and providing tools that make banking easier so they can focus on leading the way to recovery.”

Globally, young people are particularly confident, with 80 per cent of 18 to 34-year olds feeling they have the digital skills needed to thrive post-Covid-19.

However, Malaysians of all ages are highly confident in their skills, with those aged 55 to 64 feeling most equipped (93 per cent) compared to 77 per cent of those aged 18 to 34.

Yet, with many graduating or leaving school in the midst of a global recession, younger generations are more willing, or able, to adapt to the current circumstances. 79 per cent of 25 to 34-year olds in Malaysia would set up a second income stream compared to 69 per cent of those over 55; and 77 per cent of 18 to 44-year olds would reskill compared to 63 per cent of those aged 55 and above.

Millennials and Generation Z are also more likely to respond to the crisis by starting a new business. 62 per cent of Malaysians aged 18 to 44 would consider doing so in the next six months compared to 44 per cent of those aged 45 and above.

Around the world, the level of flexibility, adaptability and entrepreneurialism tends to decrease with age, along with confidence, despite – or perhaps because – older generations are more established in their careers.

The divide is even more stark when comparing developed and developing markets. Those in established global economies are not only less confident they have the digital skills needed to thrive amidst the downturn, they are also less willing to adapt and take steps to increase their income.

Over three quarters of Malaysians (78 per cent) would prefer to work more to get ahead than reduce their hours for less pay. In terms of wanting to better manage personal finances, Malaysia (83 per cent) reports one of the highest portion of people who want to better manage their money to make it go further.

And while the pandemic has acted as a catalyst for the growth of online banking, with over half globally using online services more, the shift has been more apparent in fast-growing markets.

For example, the increase in the use of mobile devices for banking services in Malaysia is 66 per cent. Fast-growth markets are also more likely to want their banks to help improve their confidence at managing money digitally as they increasingly look to bank online with 73 per cent in Malaysia agreeing this would be helpful.

There is one clear area of almost unanimous agreement; a global desire for more flexibility when it comes to working arrangements post-Covid-19.

For those for whom it is applicable, 75 per cent of Malaysians (71 per cent globally) would prefer to continue working from home for at least two days a week once restrictions are lifted and 83 per cent want more flexible working arrangements (77 per cent globally).

Serbest piyasada altın fiyatları (Gram altın ne kadar oldu?)

Altın fiyatlarında son haftalarda görülen hızlı yükseliş sürüyor. Gram altın fiyatı 473 TL dolaylarına kadar yükseldi. Geçtiğimiz haftalarda altında rekor üstüne rekor kırıldı. Altının bu kadar değer kazanmasında güvenli liman olarak görülmesi büyük rol oynuyor. İşte çeyrek, gram ve yarım altın fiyatları...


ALTIN FİYATLARI 18 AĞUSTOS


Gram altın: 473,59 lira


Çeyrek altın: 784,60 lira


Yarım altın: 1.566,80 lira


Cumhuriyet altını: 3.124,10 lira


"ALTIN FİYATLARINDA YÜKSELİŞ SÜREBİLİR"


Altın fiyatlarında tarihi dalgalanma yaşanıyor. Uluslararası spot piyasada altının ons fiyatı, geçen hafta 2 bin 75 dolarla tüm zamanların rekorunu kırdıktan sonra, dün 1863 dolara kadar gerilemişti. Bugün ise tekrar 1940 doları gördü.


Pandemi döneminde güvenli liman olarak görülen altına talebin artması, merkez banklarının faizleri rekor düşük seviyelere çekip piyasalara daha önce görülmedik düzeyde para sunması ve pandemide ikinci dalga endişeleri, altının ons fiyatının 2 bin doları aşarak rekor kırmasında etkili olmuştu.


Rusya'dan gelen ilk corona virüsü aşısının tescil edildiğine dair haber, ABD tahvil faizlerinin yükselmesi, artan risk iştahı ve kâr realizasyonu için yapılan satışlarla altın fiyatları sert düştü.


RUSYA'DAN GELEN AŞI HABERİ ETKİLEDİ

Altın fiyatlarında yükseliş hareketi sürüyor! 18 Ağustos çeyrek altın ve gram altın fiyatı ne kadar?

Altın fiyatlarında son haftalarda görülen hızlı yükseliş sürüyor. Gram altın fiyatı 473 TL dolaylarına kadar yükseldi. Geçtiğimiz haftalarda altında rekor üstüne rekor kırıldı. Altının bu kadar değer kazanmasında güvenli liman olarak görülmesi büyük rol oynuyor. İşte çeyrek, gram ve yarım altın fiyatları…
ALTIN FİYATLARI 18 AĞUSTOS
Gram altın: 473,59 lira
Çeyrek altın: 784,60 lira
Yarım altın: 1.566,80 lira
Cumhuriyet altını: 3.124,10 lira

“ALTIN FİYATLARINDA YÜKSELİŞ SÜREBİLİR”
Altın fiyatlarında tarihi dalgalanma yaşanıyor. Uluslararası spot piyasada altının ons fiyatı, geçen hafta 2 bin 75 dolarla tüm zamanların rekorunu kırdıktan sonra, dün 1863 dolara kadar gerilemişti. Bugün ise tekrar 1940 doları gördü.
Pandemi döneminde güvenli liman olarak görülen altına talebin artması, merkez banklarının faizleri rekor düşük seviyelere çekip piyasalara daha önce görülmedik düzeyde para sunması ve pandemide ikinci dalga endişeleri, altının ons fiyatının 2 bin doları aşarak rekor kırmasında etkili olmuştu.
Rusya’dan gelen ilk corona virüsü aşısının tescil edildiğine dair haber, ABD tahvil faizlerinin yükselmesi, artan risk iştahı ve kâr realizasyonu için yapılan satışlarla altın fiyatları sert düştü.

Global funds ditch Indian bonds on worries over Budget deficit, virus deaths

Global funds used to clamour for more access to India’s debt markets. The high-yielding bonds are now the least popular in Asia as the nation struggles to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
Overseas funds have sold $14.6 billion of Indian corporate and government bonds this year, the most among emerging-Asian nations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Indonesia has also seen outflows, but almost half that of India, while South Korea and Malaysia have attracted inflows.
Foreigners were already looking at India with caution given the worries over higher fiscal deficit, said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a rates strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. Covid-led risk aversion accelerated the outflows.
Global funds own just about 1.5 per cent of the local debt, compared to about 30 per cent in Indonesia. Still foreigners could be an important source of demand for sovereign debt amid a supply glut as the Modi government plans to sell a record ₹12 trillion ($160 billion) of bonds this fiscal year.
Growth worries
Meanwhile, India’s Covid-19 death toll has grown to the fourth-largest globally, with the total number of confirmed cases at more than 2.6 million. That is expected to put a damper on India’s growth, with the IMF forecasting it to be one of the worst-performing major emerging economies this year.
The prospect of a prolonged central bank pause amid rising inflation is further reducing the appeal of Indian debt. The situation in government bonds is particularly dire, with foreign holdings plunging to ₹934 billion, near a record low reached in June.
In the near term, the rupee government debt market is likely to be driven by higher-than-expected inflation and expectations over whether there would be further RBI support for bonds, said Joevin Teo, Head of Asian Fixed Income, Amundi Singapore Ltd.
For the first time in almost a year underwriters stepped in to help push a 10-year sovereign bond sale over the line on Friday, in a sign of flagging domestic demand for the debt. Concerns of an increase in sovereign borrowing have also taken hold after the RBI’s lower-than-expected dividend payout to the government.
Unless there is a big improvement toward emerging market local currency assets, it is difficult to see significant moves into the Indian market in the near term, said Manu George, Managing Director and senior fixed-income strategist at TCW Singapore Asset Management Pte.

Olam to issue S$400m 4% senior unsecured notes due 2026

Tue, Aug 18, 2020 - 10:26 AM


    OLAM International will be issuing S$400 million worth of 4 per cent fixed rate senior unsecured notes due 2026 at par value, the agri-food giant said in a bourse filing on Tuesday.

The notes will be issued under Olam's US$5 billion euro medium term note programme established in 2012. 

The notes are expected to be issued on Aug 24, 2020 and mature on Feb 24, 2026.

Proceeds will be used by the group for debt refinancing and general corporate purposes.

Olam managing director and group chief financial officer N Muthukumar said the notes issue "marks Olam’s first return to the public capital markets since 2017".


      
  
  
  
    Stay updated with BT newsletters

      
  




  
  


He added that the issue was "well subscribed on the back of strong investor demand and is Olam’s lowest ever coupon for a Singapore-dollar benchmark size transaction”.

"The issuance tenor of five years and six months helped extend our debt maturity into 2026, while still pricing within our secondary trading levels," Mr Muthukumar added.

The joint lead managers for the transaction were Australia and New Zealand Banking Group; Credit Suisse (Singapore); DBS Bank; The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Singapore Branch and Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore).

Olam shares were trading at S$1.39 as at 9.57am on Tuesday, down S$0.01 or 0.7 per cent.

Standard Chartered to Adopt Microsoft Azure to Become a Cloud-first Bank

Standard Chartered Bank and Microsoft have announced a three-year strategic partnership to accelerate the bank’s digital transformation through a cloud-first strategy. 


This partnership marks a significant milestone for Standard Chartered in making its vision for virtual banking, next-generation payments, open banking and banking-as-a-service a reality. Leveraging Azure as a preferred cloud platform, the companies will also co-innovate in open banking and real-time payments to help the bank unlock new banking experiences for clients.




 

As part of its digital transformation, Standard Chartered will adopt a multi-cloud approach, where significant applications, including its core banking and trading systems and new digital ventures such as virtual banking and banking as-a-service, will be cloud-based by 2025, subject to regulatory approvals. The bank will also adopt a cloud-first principle for all new software developments and major enhancements.


As technology reshapes the banking industry, Standard Chartered recognizes that a cloud-first strategy is critical to the bank’s ambition to make banking simpler, faster and more convenient. By being digital-first, the bank will be able to meet the demand for seamless banking virtually anytime, anywhere, and make banking more accessible to people across its network.


Standard Chartered will adopt Microsoft Azure as a preferred cloud platform to meet the bank’s need for resilient data centers and cloud services and addressing customers’ security, privacy and compliance requirements across the bank’s global footprint.


The first set of capabilities to move to Microsoft Azure will be Standard Chartered’s trade finance systems, allowing for seamless cross-border trade for the bank’s corporate and institutional clients.

China’s loss may be India’s gain in shifting supply chains

India’s latest set of incentives to entice businesses moving away from China seem to be working, with companies from Samsung Electronics Co. to Apple Inc.’s assembly partners showing interest in investing in the South Asian nation.

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in March announced incentives that make niche firms – electronics manufacturers – eligible for a payment of 4%-6% of their incremental sales over the next five years. The result: about two dozen companies pledged $1.5 billion of investments to set up mobile-phone factories in the country.

 Besides Samsung, those that have shown interest are Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known as Foxconn, Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. India has also extended similar incentives to pharmaceutical businesses, and plans to cover more sectors, which may include automobiles, textiles, and food processing under the program.

 While companies have been actively looking to diversify supply chains amid the U.S.-China trade tensions and the coronavirus outbreak, it hasn’t yet translated into big gains for India despite the nation making it cheaper for businesses to open shop. Vietnam remains the most favored destination, followed by Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand, according to a recent survey by Standard Chartered Plc.

 “There is a reasonable chance for India to gain in terms of incremental investment of supply chains within the country over the medium term,” said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Mumbai. “These programs are aimed at increasing India’s manufacturing share in the gross domestic product.”

 Samsung plans to make $40 billion worth of smartphones in India and may shift a major part of its production from Vietnam and other countries, the Economic Times reported, citing people it didn’t identify. Samsung didn’t respond to queries from the newspaper.

 The incentives would help bring an additional investment of $55 billion over five years, adding 0.5% to India’s economic output, according to analysts led by Neelkanth Mishra at Credit Suisse Group AG. This could shift an additional 10% of global smart-phone production to India in five years, most of it from China, they wrote in a report Aug. 10.

 That complements Modi’s goal to grow the share of manufacturing in the economy to 25% from the current around 15% as part of his ‘Make in India’ program. His government has already lowered taxes on companies to among the lowest in Asia, seeking to attract new investments in an economy headed for its first contraction in more than four decades this year.

 The latest output-linked incentive plan is a “big win for Make in India,” Amish Shah, an analyst at BofA Securities, said in a report to clients. He sees gains for industrials, cement, pharmaceuticals, metals and logistics, with long-term indirect benefits across many sectors. Vrishti Beniwal, Bloomberg

Gold's run 'hasn't quite finished yet,' says Standard Chartered strategist

The gold rally still has some ways to go despite its recent stumble, says Standard Chartered Private Bank's Manpreet Gill.

"We think gold's run ... hasn't quite finished yet," said Gill, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities investment strategy at the firm.

"It comes back to interest rates," he told CNBC's "Street Signs Asia" on Monday. "One of the best explanations of why gold has surged the way it has through this year have been bond yields."

"Net of inflation or what we call real bond yields, those have been sort of on (a) one-way tear and that's sort of lined up very nicely with move in gold," the strategist said.

Gold prices have had a stellar run so far in 2020, soaring to levels beyond $2,000 in early August. That hit a pause last week as prices of the precious metal fell below $2,000, with spot gold trading at $1,942.1405 per ounce Monday afternoon Singapore time.

Gill said the recent pullback in gold prices was explained by an uptick in bond yields. U.S. Treasury yields spiked early last week, as positive developments on the coronavirus vaccine front boosted risk sentiment. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was last at 0.691%. A rise in yields puts pressure on non-yielding assets such as gold given the opportunity cost of holding the latter.

"We have quite a bit of one-sided positioning in gold and I think, you know, that's actually unwound quite quickly. A lot of our proprietary indicators are telling us exactly that," he said.

Commenting on the recent uptick in Treasury yields, the strategist said: "As long as yields stay below 1%, that doesn't really alter our longer-theme that ... central banks have really liked to do whatever they can to keep bond yields capped."

Still, Gill added that it's "ultimately a great environment" for gold, assuming factors such as central banks doing their best to keep bond yields capped and the economic recovery staying the course.

Over at Fitch Solutions, analysts wrote in a Friday note: "We expect gold prices to remain supported in the coming months with rising geopolitical tensions and an uneven and slow global economic recovery."

For its part, Fitch Solutions has a 2020 gold price forecast of $1,850 per ounce, with expectations for the precious metal to "edge higher in the coming months, back to the peak reached in August 2020 and beyond."

"From a technical perspective, we believe gold prices remain positioned to the upside, respecting the underlying long-term uptrend as concerns over the global economy remain over the coming months, supporting safe haven assets including gold," the Fitch analysts said, though they acknowledged that "bouts of volatility and pullbacks in gold prices will occur during periods of strong risk appetite."

Nigerian banks earnings under pressure from pandemic impact, CBN policies

A mix of key industry fundamentals, primarily driven by the economic repercussions of the global coronavirus outbreak and a series of policies by the Central Bank of Nigeria, suggests Nigerian banks are most likely to suffer a huge decline in revenue and earnings this year.

Fitch Ratings warned this week that “punitive policies” by the apex bank will negatively affect banks’ earnings. One of such is the Cash Reserve Ratio, a policy that compels lenders to keep 27.5 percent of their deposits with the central bank and is still in effect despite banks needing cash to cushion effects of the ongoing pandemic.

CRR debits from accounts of Nigerian banks have passed ₦2 trillion this year just to manage liquidity in the system, according to reports, while the banking regulator also fines lenders that do not meet the 65 percent loan to deposit ratio regulation, aimed at stimulating credit in the economy.

Peer countries such as South Africa, Kenya, and several others across the globe, are providing buffers to afford banks more room to lend and ease the fallout of the pandemic. Nigeria meanwhile has stuck with the CRR, which is “unique and hugely punitive” amid the ongoing crisis, according to Mahin Dissanayake, Fitch Senior Director for Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Keeping the huge idle cash with the central bank in a non-interest yielding account puts “a lot of pressure” on the earnings of the banks, as they would have been put to better use through ventures such as lending, Dissanayake said, adding that enforcement of the policies and penalties has caused an effective hit on capital to between 40 percent and 50 percent.

The Fitch director expects an estimated 20 percent decline in banks’ revenue, as well as a dip in profitability, depending on the extent of charges on loan impairment. Since the virus broke out, the banking system has been grappling with loan defaults and restructuring, as well as repayment delays that could erode interest income, a key source of revenue for lenders.

Bad loans, which have always been a problem in Nigeria’s banking sector largely due to a weak macroeconomic climate, have only increased since the COVID-19 crisis began. Between the 2016 recession and now, commercial banks in the country have collectively written off at least ₦1.9 trillion worth of impaired loans, according to a banking industry report by Agusto & Co.

Based on the exposure of banks to many sectors – including oil and gas, hospitality, and aviation – that have negatively been impacted by the pandemic, there have been several loan defaults and restructuring, putting at risk banks’ asset quality in the long-run. About 22 commercial banks have so far restructured ₦7.8 trillion worth of loans out of a total of ₦19.9 trillion (some 42 percent), for more than 35,000 customers, CBN Deputy Governor for Financial System, Aisha Ahmad said at July’s monetary policy committee meeting.

More loan write-offs are expected, however. Citing the current economic challenges as well as CBN’s “erratic and unorthodox policies” over the past five years, investment bank EFG Hermes projects that banks will write off around 12.3 percent of their loan books in constant currency terms between 2020 and 2022, the highest of all the previous non-performing loans crisis faced by financial institutions in Nigeria.

Economists and financial experts have called for state intervention to protect banks after restructuring loans worth billions of dollars and extending tenure on repayments. That is needed to reduce the pressure on the banking system and would allow banks to play a central role in post-COVID recovery. “Governments should not do anything or implement policy measures that might take away the capacity of financial institutions to play their part in economic recovery,” said Razia Khan, Standard Chartered Bank’s chief economist for African operations.

Policymakers have to make a very important balancing role between immediate needs of the economic crisis and how to restore confidence and build a well-capitalized banking industry that is better able to support growth in the future, Khan said at a recent forum on economic recovery hosted by the Overseas Development Institute.

Here is why gold price uptrend is intact – Standard Chartered

Editor's Note: Get caught up in minutes with our speedy summary of today's must-read news stories and expert opinions that moved the precious metals and financial markets. Sign up here!

(Kitco News) The selloff last week did not impact the longer-term uptrend in gold, according to Standard Chartered, which sees weaker U.S. dollar and lower interest rates as the two driving forces behind the gold price rally.

“Despite the steepest sell-off since April 2013, the longer-term outlook remains constructive for gold,” said Standard Chartered precious metals analyst Suki Cooper.

Before last week's jaw-dropping pullback of nearly $200, gold looked overbought and further price gains looked uncertain.

“It will be key whether this profit-taking materialises as short-term tactical liquidation, or increased vulnerability across gold-backed ETPs, prompting caution about upside risk. Open interest and net outflows suggest that investors have liquidated stale longs, not strategic positions,” Cooper wrote on Friday.

The downside risks for gold for the rest of the summer and fall are COVID-19 vaccine, swift economic recovery, weak physical demand for gold, an increase in recycling, and more ETP outflows on rising real yields, the analyst pointed out.

Important element in all of this is that investors do not appear fatigued by the price action in gold, following a massive summer move up towards $2,100 an ounce.

“Barring further profit-taking, we think the longer-term uptrend is intact given USD weakness and the scale of stimulus and as we expect interest rates to remain low or negative. Price dips are likely to be viewed as buying opportunities as the macro backdrop remains favourable for gold,” Cooper noted.

At the time of writing, December Comex gold futures were trading at $1,993.90, up 2.26% on the day.

All of the long-term drivers remain in place — negative real rates, weak U.S. dollar, and inflation expectations.

“Over the past two weeks, gold prices have signalled greater risk aversion than other assets that usually benefit from a flight to safety, partly as longer-term investors turn to gold as a diversifier. Some of the recent interest in gold has been spurred by expectations of further stimulus measures and concerns that balance-sheet expansion globally could lead to higher inflation,” Cooper said.

The weakest link is the physical demand out of Asia, which is still lacklustre. High gold price in local currencies as well as the coronavirus-related issues are all weighing on demand.

“The local gold price in India has eased from record highs above 56,000 INR/10g, but not by much. The local market has swung sharply back to a premium, but the increase has been driven by lower inventory rather than higher demand during the seasonally slow period for demand. Seasonal demand tends to materialise in September; even though the monsoon forecast should support a recovery in demand, high and volatile prices may offset this,” Cooper said.

Central bank gold buying has also slowed with some central banks proceeding with “modest sales,” the analyst added. “We expect net buying of 360t in 2020.”

Turkey is one of the central banks still buying gold this year, purchasing 220 metric tons year-to-date.

Here’s the recipe spicing up my venture

Here’s the recipe spicing up my venture

In the days Anzazi Kiti was boarding in high school, she craved her mother’s finger-licking meals.

During school holidays, she would mix vegetables and spices which she would carry to school to make her food tasty.

Despite supplying her colleagues too, the challenge was always that the mixture would get molds and go bad before school term ended.

Years down the line and after conducting research, Ms Kiti found the secret to longer shelf life for her food seasoning products. Now she has turned them into a commercial venture.

In 2016, she started Taste Afrique Company, which she co-owns with her sisters Winnie Chiwai and Gift Kiti.



The company manufactures, distributes and sells natural food seasoning products made from ingredients such as onions, garlic, ginger, cardamom, black paper and cloves.

“We basically add value to the vegetables and spices to come up with a product that is tasty and has a longer shelve life,” says the 31-year-old BA Economics and Finance graduate from Kenyatta University.

The product’s name is “chibundiro” which comes from the word “bunda” in Swahili that means to grind. In her Chonyi community, chibundiro means a mortar and a paste — items used to grind. Growing up, Ms Kiti says she was always in the kitchen with her mother curious to learn the art of mixing various things to make meals tasty.

After high school, she researched on improving the product, popularly known as mkaango and that’s when she learned tricks of giving it longer shelf life.

“We have hot, mild and without chili precooked seasoning that is just sprinkled on food. Then we have the mixed spices namely siri ya chai, siri ya mchuzi and siri ya pilau,” said Ms Kiti who previously worked as a forensic auditor with Deloitte as well as Ernst and Young.

While employed, she would make ten cans of chibundiro every weekend to sell to colleagues at the office and other people through referrals.

She quit employment to focus on the business on realisation that her passion would put her in a path of conflict with her employer.

Today, Taste Afrique supplies retail chains such as Quickmart, Naivas, Tuskys, Chandarana, Eastmatt, Woolmart in Nakuru. She also sells to Clean Chef and Chieni Supermarket in Nyeri, Narumoru and Nanyuki.

Packaging is in glass jars of 3.5grams, 70grams, 100grams (reserved for export), 150grams and 250grams (also known as the family-size).

The business has grown rapidly and now has five agents in the United States and one each in the United Kingdom and Uganda. The agents buy in large quantities then resell at a profit to their customers.

The venture that started with Sh4,800 now rakes an average of Sh1 million in monthly turnover and has ten employees.

The Covid-19 pandemic has however seen a decline in sales as retailers shy away from taking new stock.

She says the initial capital was raised from a project by Kenyatta University and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) where groups with scalable business ideas were financed.

“So I gave the mkaango idea to our group, we showcased and got the financing,” says Ms Kiti who also has a Master of Science degree in Finance.

After the training was done, she decided to actualise her business dream.

She invested the Sh4,800 on raw materials, packaging material (plastics at the time) and sold around 300 pieces going for Sh120 each.

From the sales revenue, she deducted her profit and returned an equivalent of the initial capital to the organisers of the project.

Taste Afrique has engaged nine small holder farmers who supply raw materials to its plant located on Lang’ata Road in Nairobi.

So inspiring is Taste Afrique venture that it was selected among five women-led start-ups that received Sh1 million seed funding in a programme funded by the Standard Chartered Bank and implemented at iBizAfrica- Strathmore University.

The five were awarded after completing three-month incubation at iBizAfrica-Strathmore University’s tech incubator.

The others were Soul Food, Benacare, Nature’s Touch and Arbes Biotech and were selected from 380 applicants that are using technology to tackle problems afflicting the community.

Over the past 60 days, the stock has witnessed its earnings estimates for 2020 and 2021 being revised 26.3% and 12.4% upward, respectively, reflecting analysts' optimism on the stock.

The company reported second-quarter 2020 earnings of 4 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was of a loss of 33 cents. This outperformance was led by a solid contribution from its epay Segment.

The company’s top-line improvement has also been impressive, witnessing a CAGR of 11.6% during the 2015-2019 period on solid segmental results and its diversity across products and geographies.

It also reassigned agreements with the Indonesian Post for 4,000 locations among others. In the second quarter, Euronet inked a deal with Millennium Bank in Poland, Standard Chartered Bank in Pakistan and Ohridska Bank in North Macedonia to name a few.

It has been gaining on the back of its solid segments as well. EFT Segment has been witnessing sturdy growth, driven by the company’s steady focus on deploying more devices across the extended markets and its ability to develop an advanced technology for new products on both ATMs and POS terminals for optimizing and enriching the customer experience. Per management, the run rate of these expenses should continue to benefit the third and the fourth quarter. The company expects a significant recovery in 2021 for the EFT segment as travel resumes.

In epay, some of the most significant product distribution expansions were enabled by mobile wallets.

China’s loss might be India’s gain in supply chain shift - Taipei Times

China’s loss might be India’s gain in supply chain shift

                                                

                India’s latest set of incentives to entice businesses moving away from China seem to be working, with companies from Samsung Electronics Co to Apple Inc’s assembly partners showing interest in investing in the South Asian nation.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in March announced incentives that make niche firms — electronics manufacturers — eligible for a payment of 4 to 6 percent of their incremental sales over the next five years.
The result: About two dozen companies pledged US$1.5 billion of investments to set up mobile-phone factories in the country.
Besides Samsung, those that have shown interest are Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (鴻海精密) — known internationally as Foxconn Technology Group (富士康科技集團) — Wistron Corp (緯創) and Pegatron Corp (和碩).
India has also extended similar incentives to pharmaceutical businesses, and plans to cover more sectors, which might include automobiles, textiles and food processing under the program.
        
        
        
    

    While companies have been actively looking to diversify supply chains amid US-China trade tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic, it has not yet translated into big gains for India, despite the nation making it cheaper for businesses to open shop.
Vietnam remains the most favored destination, followed by Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Thailand, according to a recent survey by Standard Chartered PLC.
“There is a reasonable chance for India to gain in terms of incremental investment of supply chains within the country over the medium term,” said Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Mumbai. “These programs are aimed at increasing India’s manufacturing share in the gross domestic product.”
Samsung plans to make US$40 billion worth of smartphones in India and might shift a major part of its production from Vietnam and other countries, the Economic Times reported, citing people it did not identify. Samsung did not respond to queries from the newspaper.
The incentives would help bring an additional investment of US$55 billion over five years, adding 0.5 percent to India’s economic output, analysts led by Neelkanth Mishra at Credit Suisse Group AG said.
This could shift an additional 10 percent of global smartphone production to India in five years, most of it from China, they wrote in a report on Monday last week.
That complements Modi’s goal to grow the share of manufacturing in the economy to 25 percent from about 15 percent as part of his “Make in India” program. His government has already lowered taxes on companies to among the lowest in Asia, seeking to attract new investments in an economy headed for its first contraction in more than four decades this year.
The latest output-linked incentive plan is a “big win for Make in India,” BofA Securities Inc analyst Amish Shah said in a report to clients.
Shah said he sees gains for industrials, cement, pharmaceuticals, metals and logistics, with long-term indirect benefits across many sectors.

China's Loss = India's Gain As Samsung, Apple, Others Eye Phone Factories

India's latest set of incentives to entice businesses moving away from China seem to be working, with companies from Samsung Electronics Co to Apple Inc's assembly partners showing interest in investing in the country.

Standard Chartered and Airtel Africa form partnership to drive financial inclusion across Africa

By Andrew Laxton is the CEO and Co-Founder of Mixology Communications

With the UK officially in recession, unemployment reaching its worse level in a decade and High Street banks bracing themselves for another round of job cuts to cover escalating bad debt, how is the new kid on the block, the digital banking sector, faring in these troubled times?

Not so well, according to recent news headlines.

Revolut, the UK’s highest value fintech start-up at £4.25 billion, recently announced that its pre-tax loss more than tripled to £107 million before heading into the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the firm’s revenue increasing by 163% and the number of retail customers growing from 3.5 million to 10 million, its costs nearly tripled to £270 million as it invested in new products and growth.

Monzo last month cast significant doubt over its ability to continue as a going concern after losses more than doubled to £118 million. While its Board expressed confidence in its ability to raise capital if needed, the reality would suggest otherwise with the fintech sector globally struggling to raise funding since the pandemic hit. In addition, investors are beginning to turn their attention to brands that have a clear Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance mandate embedded within their business.

Digital challenger bank Starling is the smallest of the three and while also doubling its losses for 2019, looks set to break even this year by putting £1 billion of lending on its balance sheet after taking part in the government’s emergency coronavirus financing schemes. Net interest is expected to deliver Starling about £80 million in revenue, giving the bank a break-even target for 2020.

While domestic spending has increased during the pandemic, the flipside is customer spending abroad has crashed through the floor. This has led to tighter control over cost and significant reductions in discretionary spending.  And with the Bank of England predicting more than one million jobs will be lost by Christmas, it is unlikely consumer spending will continue at its current rate.

With all three digital banks seeing a steep increase in new customers, the importance placed on transparent stakeholder communications and brand reputation is now more important than ever.

The banking sector has always struggled with its image around trust – it is an industry widely perceived as putting profit before purpose and that outdated mindset simply doesn’t fly with today’s values-based society.  Put simply, the banking industry needs a reputation overhaul.

Banks have a well-publicised track record of responding to issues reactively with very little forward planning that assesses the risk to their reputation and most importantly of all – their customers.

This is where digital banks have a massive advantage over their High Street counterparts but have failed to capitalise. Their business model is born from a highly technical and deeply embedded digital infrastructure which makes it easier to identify issues before they become problems and have solutions ready before they become disruptions.

Customer behaviour is also changing as a result of Covid-19. As society becomes more accustomed to working and living from home, ease of access to remote and secure banking services has become of greater importance.

The world in which we now live is also very different, which brings with it another set of expectations from society. This has the potential to play perfectly into the hands of the digital banking sector, but a different approach is needed.

With unemployment continuing to climb and salary reductions widespread, compassionate credit is seen as a sensible hedging strategy to help stabilise society while the economy takes time to recover. We’ve already seen mortgage holidays offered by High Street banks and car dealers are now offering 12-month job loss protection on financing. What role can digital banks play in providing a secure financing model to encourage future ethical consumer spending and continued business investment?

There is also a need for greater inclusion. To connect with different generations and literacy levels, should digital training become part of the onboarding process for every new customer as well as virtual access to ongoing financial education?

And how about a dedicated relationship manager? People have shown they can cope with living remotely but they still want to feel connected to a community or an individual that is familiar with their personal banking history and not an outsourced customer service centre where teleoperators are trained to perform like robots devoid of empathy and emotional intelligence. We’ve seen this work effectively with remote access to GPs during lockdown.

In this era of ‘business for good’, stakeholders demand better corporate behaviour and want to see meaningful community engagement and a genuine desire to make a positive contribution to society. This is where transparent ESG communications will play a critical role in rebuilding trust, strengthening reputation and encouraging greater brand loyalty among customers.

And finally, it is all about the data. Proof points on how digital banks aggregate, analyse and manage customer data ethically and securely will always be of paramount importance.

Stakeholder trust and reputation is lost when brands fail to listen to or underestimate the people who support them. The formula for getting it wrong has never changed.

The future for digital banks is bright but only if their Boards accept their industry, which is already showing signs of fatigue, must change with the passage of time.

24 Exchange's FX NDF ADV Touched $100 Million

24 Exchange, the over-the-counter (OTC) platform established by Fastmatch founder Dmitri Galinov, announced on Monday that the average daily volume (ADV) for its FX NDFs has reached $100 million.

The platform also highlighted that Wall Street giant JP Morgan is one of the active traders of its FX NDFs.

The Most Diverse Audience to Date at FMLS 2020 – Where Finance Meets Innovation

“In a very short period of time, 24 Exchange has topped $100 Million in Average Daily Volume, exceeding most competitors and establishing our platform as a must-access venue for FX NDFs,” Galinov, founder and CEO of the platform, said in a statement.

“We are looking forward to working alongside J.P. Morgan to continue the growth and expansion of our robust trading platform.”

Operated by 24 Exchange Bermuda Limited, the platform was established last year after Galinov sold Fastmatch in 2017 for $153 million.

24 Exchange offers multi-asset class trading and is targeting clients with a promise of offering “most cost-effective trades across a growing range of asset classes, 24 hours a day.” The exchange also highlights that though it is based in Bermuda, it is not regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority and is fully compliant with the FX Global Code.

“There is growing demand for further electronification of the NDF markets,” Eddie Wen, global head of digital markets for JP Morgan, added. “24 Exchange reduces the client burden of technology infrastructure, allowing for more efficient access to electronic liquidity by market participants.”

“The platform will offer greater choice of trading venues for our clients. J.P. Morgan believes that innovation and choice are fundamental to the long-term growth of electronic markets. We look forward to being part of the growth of this robust and important platform.”

In May, Finance Magnates reported that banking giant Standard Chartered brought an undisclosed stake in 24 Exchange, as a part of its strategic investment.

Blockchain, "Spunta" premiata ai Digital Banking Awards

La tecnologia blockchain made in Italy per il settore bancario ottiene un prestigioso riconoscimento internazionale. Spunta, nata dalla partnership tra Abi, Abi Lab, R3, Ntt Data, Sia e una serie di istituti di credito che hanno adottato il progetto pilota, e che oggi è operativa per 55 banche, pari all’82% del settore in termini di dipendenti, è stata premiata dalla testata “The Banker”; del gruppo Financial Times, nella sezione Technology joint venture dei Digital Banking awards.  Spunta, si legge in una nota di Abi, “è stata quindi inserita tra i giganti dell’innovazione in banca del mondo, con Bbva, Santander, Bradesco, Standard Chartered, Bnp, in una categoria inserita per la prima volta quest’anno.

“Senza dubbio – dice The Banker motivando il premio – il 2020 è stato un anno di grandi cambiamenti. Milioni di dipendenti e clienti in tutto il mondo hanno dovuto compiere un significativo passaggio dall’ufficio al lavoro a domicilio e il commercio è stato ulteriormente spinto nel mondo digitale. Molti hanno commentato che queste novità – che si tratti di prodotti, servizi o modi di lavorare – che avrebbero impiegato mesi o anni per essere implementate in circostanze normali, o addirittura considerate impossibili, sono state realizzate in giorni o settimane per pressanti necessità. Durante la rapida ristrutturazione della vita di tutti i giorni, è diventato ovvio che le risorse che le banche di tutto il mondo hanno investito nel trasformare digitalmente le loro attività da cima a fondo nell’ultimo decennio sono state ripagate durante la crisi di Covid-19”.

Quanto a Spunta banca Dlt, è una soluzione, dice The Banker, “basata su una tecnologia di registri distribuiti (Distributed ledger technology – Dlt) per il processo di riconciliazione interbancaria italiana, che coinvolge l’intero settore bancario italiano, Associazione bancaria italiana, il suo centro di ricerca e innovazione Abi Lab, oltre alle aziende tecnologiche R3, SIA e NTT Data. Il suo potenziale di trasformazione ha assicurato a questo progetto il riconoscimento per la più innovativa joint venture tecnologica. Le transazioni – aggiunge The Banker – vengono riconciliate quotidianamente, non mensilmente come prima. Inoltre, le banche ottengono la piena visibilità del conto. Altri vantaggi includono la corrispondenza automatica condivisa e affidabile e il canale di comunicazione integrato nell’applicazione. La tecnologia dello smart contract fornisce inoltre alle banche un feedback automatico sulle loro transazioni. I risultati includono un rischio operativo inferiore e processi più rapidi e trasparenti, tutti forniti attraverso un’interfaccia intuitiva”.

E in futuro la stessa tecnologia potrebbe essere la base per dare vita a nuove applicazioni, come l’estenzione del progetto in ambito internazionale o in campi diversi da quello bancario. Tra le ipotesi, infine, c’è una sperimentazione per la defnizione di una piattaforma informatica che supporti il dialogo fra i vari attori coinvolti nella erogazione del credito garantito dallo Stato alle imprese e ai cittadini che ne hanno diritto, dando attuazione certa dei criteri stabiliti nelle normative.

Low demand for dollars shields shilling from weakening

The shilling has been shielded from weakening because of low demand from importers, high yield on government securities and the central bank monetary policy actions, according to market players. 

The shilling has remained stable amid devastating effects brought about by Covid-19. 

The unit, according to analysts, has also benefited from inflows from non-governmental organisations and Covid-19 related support from the international community. 

In June, the shilling strengthened against the dollar by about 1.4 per cent, mainly due to low demand from importers, corporate sector and manufacturers. 

Inflows, especially from coffee earnings, also contributed with the unit going for an average mid-rate of Shs3,738 compared to Shs3,791.46 in May. 

However, the shilling traded weaker against both the Euro and the Pound Sterling, registering a decline of 1.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively. 



The unit closed the week at Shs3,664.94 on the buying side and Shs3,674.96 on the selling side. 
Dr Adam Mugume, the Bank of Uganda executive director for research, told Daily Monitor last week that “exchange rate stability with bias towards appreciation has largely been due to measures undertaken by the Central Bank to stabilise the market when the foreign exchange market experienced volatility. 

“Attractive yields on government securities combined with stable macroeconomic outlook have attracted portfolio inflows,” he said. 
Mr Charles Katongole, the Standard Chartered Bank head of financial markets, said the shilling had gained in the recent past due to the fact that offshore investors had been active in Uganda’s financial market. 
“Whenever there is a bond issuance, investors come in. Lately, there was a 15-year bond and they came quite heavily. They lowered interest rate in their countries yet in the [local market] they are higher than what is in their [offshore investors] countries,” he said.

Airtel Africa to create new finance products

Airtel Africa has partnered with Standard Chartered to increase access to mobile financial services.

The strategic collaboration will focus on bringing “co-created, innovative” new products to key markets, starting with banking transfers for customers in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

As such, Airtel Money’s customers will be able to make real-time online deposits and withdrawals from Standard Chartered bank accounts, receive international money transfers directly to their wallets, and access savings products, amongst other services.

Meanwhile, Standard Chartered’s corporate clients will be able to make rapid and secure bulk disbursements, such as payroll payments, directly into the Airtel Money customer’s wallet. In a statement, the two said this “reduces the risks associated with travelling long distances for cash payments and instead customers can go to any Airtel Money agent, kiosk, or branch to cash-out their funds”.

Raghunath Mandava (pictured), CEO, Airtel Africa, said: “Our relationship with Standard Chartered boosts financial inclusion across the continent, giving millions of people access to valuable banking services.

“We continue to invest heavily in cashing in and cashing out locations for our customers and increase our distribution. This means that our customers can now send or receive digital payments via Standard Chartered Bank directly to their mobile phones, as well as cash-out their funds at our exclusive kiosks and branches at their convenience. This highlights Airtel Africa’s commitment to providing affordable, innovative, best-in-class solutions to enhance the daily lives of our customers.”

This latest partnership builds on the earlier success of Airtel Money, which in the last full financial year was credited as a major driver of the company’s 11.2% revenue growth.

Speaking at the time, Mandava said: “These results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and the effectiveness of our strategy – with all three business services, voice, data and mobile money, contributing to revenue growth. We have also continued to invest in future growth opportunities.”

Airtel Money represented 9% of the group’s gross revenues, but the concept of mobile money in Africa has been an established revenue driver since the early 2010s. In August 2019, analysts at Goldman Sachs predicted a 9% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the total revenue for Airtel Africa between that financial year and 2024, composed of a CAGR of 18% in data usage and 30% in mobile money.

Further, the data and mobile money segments were expected to contribute 52% and 37% of total subscribers, respectively, in FY24 from 30% and 15% in FY19.

Commenting on the latest partnership, Sunil Kaushal, Regional CEO, Africa and Middle East Standard Chartered said: “By collaborating with innovative organisations like Airtel Africa, we are accelerating our mobile and digital-led strategy to provide best in class financial services to Africa.

“Over the past year, Standard Chartered has rapidly launched digital banks across nine countries on the continent, allowing our customers to enjoy seamless services from the safety of their homes even during the peak of the pandemic,” he added.

Following the launch of mobile banking transfers between Airtel and Standard Chartered customers, other products will be rolled out later this year, subject to regulatory approvals.

As soon as the Covid-19 pandemic hit Vietnam, the London-backed lender has been quick to respond with appropriate policies and measures.

The bank has introduced a series of relief measures to help its corporate and retail clients eliminate financial burden. They include exemption or reduction of interest rates, provision of credit facilities to serve production and business activities and moratorium on loan repayment. These will be considered at clients' requests and approved on a case-by-case basis, with priority given to those severely impacted by the novel virus.

As soon as the coronavirus pandemic hit Vietnam, Standard Chartered Vietnam has been quick to respond with appropriate policies and measures. 


"We understand that individuals and businesses in Vietnam are facing unprecedented challenges. We hope that the relief measures will help our clients tide over this stressful period," said Sapru.

But that is not all, according to the CEO, the bank will continue to review the measures to provide adequate support to clients.

Along with that, local businesses will also benefit from Standard Chartered's global commitment of $1 billion financing, available for companies that provide goods and services to help the fight against COVID-19, and those planning the switch into making products that are in high demand to fight the global pandemic.

The lender has recently extended local business Tecomen a credit limit of VND40 billion ($1.73 million) as working capital for the production of its medical masks in a bid to meet the increasing demand for medical supplies in the global combat against the pandemic.

Recently, Standard Chartered Vietnam has joined hands with the Vietnam Women Entrepreneurs Council (VWEC), under the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), to launch a financial support programme for women-owned enterprises.

Within its framework, the bank will provide $25 million of uncommitted credit facilities with tenor of up to 365 days, along with complimentary training on financial education, market updates, and regular sharing sessions on topics of interest.

"Through this financial support programme, we hope to help women entrepreneurs navigate through this challenging period and gain access to capital financing and high-quality financial advice to successfully build their business for the long run," stressed the CEO.

Meanwhile, the bank also regularly organises webinars to update its individual and business clients with the group's latest views on the global, regional, and country outlooks, as part of an attempt to help them develop appropriate investment and business strategies during this difficult time.

For the community as a whole, Standard Chartered Vietnam has made a series of monetary donations, worth $200,000 (VND4.6 billion), and other in-kind donations to support the COVID-19 prevention and relief efforts in the country.

The fund has subsequently been allocated to various hospitals and charity organisations to spend on critical medical equipment and aid disadvantaged children and young adults.

 
Standard Chartered has been throwing its full weight behind programmes to combat COVID-19 


The corporation also launched the fundraising "Work from Home Workout Challenge" earlier on, which then contributed some VND450 million ($19,560) in donations and helped thousands of people including its staff, clients, and the community stay mentally and physically healthy amid the outbreak.

It is worth to mention that to prepare for a long ride with the local economy into the future, Standard Chartered Vietnam has been known to invest heavily in its people and workplace, believing that being good from the inside out will allow the lender to provide clients superior products and services and at the same time enable its sustainable growth and development.

Standard Chartered Bank Vietnam has, for the third consecutive year, been named one of the Best Companies to Work for in Asia by HR Asia, one of Asia's leading publications for HR professionals.

"Investing in people and the workplace has been and will continue to be a priority of Standard Chartered Bank Vietnam as we spare no efforts to be the bank of choice for our clients," stressed CEO Sapru.

Billionaire Agarwal’s Vedanta Tests India Junk Bond Demand

(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources is marketing a dollar bond in a crucial test of investor appetite for Indian junk debt.
The commodities giant is offering a three-year amortizing note with an initial price guidance of around 13.25%, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The fundraising is critical for Vedanta Resources, whose plans to delist its Indian unit Vedanta Ltd. still face hurdles including getting stock exchange approvals. The proceeds of the offering will be used to partially fund the privatization. Any surplus money will go toward a tender offer of Vedanta Resources 2021 dollar bonds or repayment of the securities at maturity, the person familiar said.
SP Global Ratings said last week that if the privatization goes through, Vedanta Resources’ credit rating is set to be upgraded, and any failure would mean immediate downgrade pressure. Vedanta Resources also plans to fund the privatization with a loan.
According to a preliminary offering circular dated Aug. 11, Vedanta Resources has received commitments from lenders for up to $1.75 billion. That can be drawn through a three-month bridge facility or a bank guarantee and the terms are subject to change.
The commodity giant’s bonds have staged a stunning comeback since slumping to distressed levels in March, and according to UBS Group AG, the securities have priced in a successful delisting of its unit. If completed, the privatization will make Vedanta Resources’ organizational structure cleaner and give the company better access to cash.
While there have been some signs of credit strains easing recently, riskier Indian borrowers have faced push-back from investors as the country grapples with a slowing economy after the world’s biggest lockdown amid the pandemic. A SoftBank Group Corp.-backed renewable energy company postponed a dollar bond in July.
The last Indian high-yield dollar bond was sold by Lodha Developers in March, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.
Under the terms of the notes, the issuer is required to redeem the bonds if it decides not to complete the privatization or stock exchange approval is not received by 45 days after the settlement day.
Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan and Standard Chartered Plc are joint global coordinators and bookrunners for the deal.

瑞士信貸：印度5年內將從中國搶走全球10％手機產能 - 自由財經

印度政府推動「印度製造」，外界指多少都會看到些成果。（法新社）

〔財經頻道／綜合報導〕印度政府日前推動的設廠獎勵計劃，得到全球手機最大品牌三星電子，以及蘋果（Apple）主要的3間iPhone組裝廠：鴻海、和碩及緯創的響應，專家認為，就算印度不是吸引供應鏈撤出中國的首選地，但是在設廠獎勵的激勵下，印度仍能在當前的基礎上，再從中國那邊搶走相當於全球10%手機的產能。

《彭博》報導，印度政府估計，設廠計劃將讓印度在5年內生產價值1530億美元的電子產品，並增加約100萬個工作機會；瑞士信貸（Credit Suisse）分析師團隊則認為，設廠計劃將讓印度電子產品生產方面，未來5年增加55億美元的投資，使印度經濟產出增加0.5%，並使印度再搶走全球10%的手機產能，而這些產能原本多數是在中國。
請繼續往下閱讀...
    
    
        
    


事實上，印度目前尚不是供應鏈轉出中國的首選地，渣打銀行（Standard Chartered）調查顯示，越南目前依然是首選地，其次是柬埔寨、緬甸、孟加拉及泰國等。

不過目前印度政府已經將企業稅率降至幾近亞洲國家最低，德意志銀行（Deutsche Bank）印度首席經濟學家達斯（Kaushik Das）認為，印度中期看到供應鏈投資增漲是非常可能，將增加印度GDP中的製造業比重。

除了電子以外，印度還要對製藥提出類似的激勵措施，並可能擴展到汽車、紡織、食品加工等；美銀證券（BofA Securities）分析師沙阿（Amish Shah）認為，水泥、製藥、金屬及物流等行業，長期將受益於在印度的廠房擴展。

‘Cowardly act of hate’: CEO Ho Ching slams social media doxxing of Temasek's Indian employees | Malay Mail

SINGAPORE — Temasek Holdings chief executive officer Ho Ching took to Facebook yesterday to call out social media posts which targeted the Indian employees of her firm and two banks, lambasting these acts of doxxing as “a cowardly act of hate.”

“Is it acceptable to complain about unfair hiring practices? Sure it is, provided it is based on facts, and not hearsay and speculations. Is it acceptable to tarnish individuals, and dox them with photos and false claims? Nope, that’s a cowardly act of hate,” she said.

In the 438-word post, Ho, who is the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, also urged netizens not to dox individuals based on their race or nationality so as to “stir hate and hatred.”

Those with a grievance should report the matter to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), to the board of the company or to their regulator, or “better still reskill, upskill, to remain relevant in a fast changing world,” she said.

Over the past week, the LinkedIn profiles of some Indian employees of Temasek, DBS Bank and Standard Chartered Bank were posted on social media by netizens questioning why these foreigners had been hired in these organisations instead of locals.

This came after MOM placed 47 employers on a watch list for potentially discriminatory hiring practices earlier this month. It was revealed that 30 of these companies were in the financial services and professional services sectors.

On Friday, Temasek issued a strongly-worded statement to condemn the posts as “racist,” “false” and “divisive.” It also defended its hiring policies, and called for more civility on social media.

“Some of our colleagues from India have been targeted recently on social media by a divisive, racist campaign. This makes us very angry at the false claims perpetuated. The Singaporeans among us are also ashamed at such hateful behaviour on the Singapore social media,” the investment company said.

Temasek said it had alerted Facebook about the posts, which were in clear breach of the platform’s own community guidelines on hate speech, adding that it “will continue to press them to be more active in stamping out such hate speech, wherever it occurs on their platforms.”

A spokesperson from Facebook told TODAY that the posts in question were reviewed and removed from Facebook “where we found content that violated our hate speech policies.” She declined to reveal the number of posts that were reviewed and removed.

In addressing the make-up of its workforce, Temasek on Friday said Singaporeans form 60 per cent of those hired in its offices across eight countries. Of the remaining 40 per cent, 10 per cent of them are permanent residents here.

It also said that the top five countries that its staff come from, other than Singapore, are China (9 per cent), the United States of America (7 per cent), India (6 per cent), the United Kingdom (3 per cent) and Malaysia (3 per cent).

Temasek also revealed that among its 600-strong staff at its headquarters in Singapore, 90 per cent are Singapore citizens or permanent residents. This proportion remains “broadly the same” among senior leadership — those who are managing directors and above.

When chiming in on the saga yesterday, Ho said: “Let’s not be fooled by anyone who tries to stir up racial biases that lurks beneath everyone of us. It is a very short distance between hating one’s nationality to one race and very soon, anyone who is different.”

She then stated that unfair practices can happen “anytime anywhere, regardless of race, language and religion.”

And while Singaporeans have an “ideal” of meritocracy regardless of race, language, or religion to uphold, they are not all “pure, innocent and just,” she said.

“We can be knowing or even unknowingly biased and prejudiced,” she said, pointing out that Singapore’s strength of diversity is also its weakness. “It takes work, effort, and self discipline to stay away from the emotional and divisive politics of hate.” — TODAY
